abstract = {Human populations worldwide are vulnerable to natural disasters. Certain conditions-such as geographical location or people's income level-can affect the degree to which natural disasters impact people's homes and livelihoods. This paper suggests that vulnerability to natural disasters increases when local people, scientists, and policymakers do not communicate and trust each other. Additionally, a breakdown in interaction and confidence among these groups can disrupt the implementation of sound science or well-intentioned policies. This case study analyzes how local people, scientists, and government officials responded to glacier hazards in Peru's Cordillera Blanca mountain range. Cordillera Blanca glacier retreat since the late-19th century has triggered some of the world's most deadly avalanches and glacial lake outburst floods. Although a Peruvian glaciology and lakes security office has "controlled" 35 Cordillera Blanca glacial lakes, 30 glacier disasters have killed nearly 30,000 people in this region since 1941. A lack of local faith in government officials and scientists as well as the State's failure to follow scientists' warnings about potential disasters have endangered or led to the death of thousands of local residents, many of which remain living in hazard zones today. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {It is important to understand recent changes in the velocity of Greenland glaciers because the mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet is partly determined by the flow rates of these outlets. Jakobshavn Isbrae is Greenland's largest outlet glacier, draining about 6.5 per cent of the ice-sheet area, and it has been surveyed repeatedly since 1991 (ref. 2). Here we use remote sensing data to measure the velocity of Jakobshavn Isbrae between 1992 and 2003. We detect large variability of the velocity over time, including a slowing down from 6,700 m yr(-1) in 1985 to 5,700 m yr(-1) in 1992, and a subsequent speeding up to 9,400 m yr(-1) by 2000 and 12,600 m yr(-1) in 2003. These changes are consistent with earlier evidence for thickening of the glacier in the early 1990s and rapid thinning thereafter. Our observations indicate that fast-flowing glaciers can significantly alter ice discharge at sub-decadal timescales, with at least a potential to respond rapidly to a changing climate.},

abstract = {The glacial geology of Maine records the northward recession of the Late Wisconsinan Laurentide Ice Sheet, followed by development of a residual ice cap in the Maine-Qu??bec border region due to marine transgression of the St. Lawrence Lowland in Canada. The pattern of deglaciation across southern Maine has been reconstructed from numerous end moraines, deltas and submarine fans deposited during marine transgression of the coastal lowland. Inland from the marine limit, a less-detailed sequence of deglaciation is recorded by striation patterns, meltwater channels, scattered moraines and waterlain deposits that constrain the trend of the ice margin. There is no evidence that the northern Maine ice cap extended as far south-west as the Boundary Mountains and New Hampshire border. Newly-obtained radiocarbon ages from marine and terrestrial ice-proximal environments have improved the chronology of glacial recession in Maine. Many of these ages were obtained by coring Late-glacial sediments beneath ponds and lakes. Data from this study show that the state was deglaciated between about 14.5 and 10.0 ka BP (14C years). The coastal moraine belt in southern Maine was deposited by oscillatory ice-margin retreat during the cold pre-B??lling time. Rapid ice recession to northern Maine then occurred between 13 and 11 ka BP, during the warmer B??lling/Aller??d chronozones. Radiocarbon-dated pond sediments in western and northern Maine show lithological evidence of Younger Dryas climatic cooling and persistence of the northern ice cap into Younger Dryas time. A large discrepancy still exists between radiocarbon ages of deglaciation in coastal south-western Maine and the timing of ice retreat indicated by New England varve records in areas to the west. Part of this problem may stem from the uncertainty of reservoir corrections applied to the radiocarbon ages of marine organics. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Twenty-thousand years ago, the earth was held in thrall by re-lentlessly probing fingers of ice-ice that drew its power from frigid strongholds in the north, and flowed southward to bury forests, fields, and mountains. Landscapes that were violated by the slowly moving glaciers would carry the scars of this advance far into the future. Temperatures plummeted, and land surfaces in many parts of the world were depressed by the unrelenting weight of the thrusting ice. At the same time, so much water was drawn from the Ocean to form these gargantuan glaciers that sea levels around the world fell by 350 feet, and large areas of the continental shelf became dry land. This period in the earth's history has come to be called the ice age. In North America, glacial ice spread out from centers near Hudson Bay to bury all of eastern Canada, New England, and much of the Midwest under a sheet of ice that averaged more than a mile in thickness. A second ice sheet spread out from centers in the Canadian Rockies and other highlands in western North America to engulf parts of Alaska, all of western Canada, and portions of Washington, Idaho, and Montana. In Europe, the ice reached outward from Scandinavia and Scotland to cover most of Great Britain, Denmark, and large parts of northern Germany, Poland, and the Soviet Union. A smaller ice cap, centered on the Alps, buried all of Switzerland and nearby portions of Austria, Italy, France, and Germany. In the southern hemisphere, small ice sheets developed over parts of Australia, N e w Zealand, and Argentina. In all, the ice covered about 11 million square miles of land that is today free of ice. Immediately south of these great northern-hemisphere ice sheets, the landscape was treeless tundra.

abstract = {In a steady-state ocean, input fluxes of dissolved salts to the sea must be balanced in mass and isotopic value by output fluxes. For the elements strontium, calcium, and carbon, rivers provide the primary input, whereas marine biogenic sedimentation dominates removal. Dissolved fluxes in rivers are related to rates of continental weathering, which in turn are strongly dependent on rates of uplift. The largest dissolved fluxes today arise in the Himalayan and Andean mountain ranges and the Tibetan Plateau. During the past 5 m.y., uplift rates in these areas have increased significantly; this suggests that weathering rates and river fluxes may have increased also. The oceanic records of carbonate sedimentation, level of the calcite compensation depth, and S13C and S87Sr in biogenic sediments are consistent with a global increase in river fluxes since the late Miocene. The cooling of global climate over the past few million years may be linked to a decrease in atmospheric C02 driven by enhanced continental weathering in these tectonically active regions.},

abstract = {We show that the ice plain in the mouth of Whillans Ice Stream (formerly Ice Stream B), Antarctica, moves by stick-slip motion. During a spring-tide period, rapid motions regularly occur near high tide and during falling tide. This correlation is weaker during a neap-tide period when the tidal magnitudes are less. Precise timing of these motion events suggests that they propagate through the region with a mean velocity of 88 m s(-1). We hypothesize that this speed is associated with the propagation of shear waves through a wet subglacial till. Motion events are also seen on more smoothly flowing floating ice. Event delays are very short between grounded and floating stations, suggesting the events propagate through the ice shelf as an elastic wave. We further hypothesize the events are caused by the interaction of a sticky bed, the accumulation of stored elastic strain through the compression of ice by upstream inflow, and tidal forcing. Motion events seem to be triggered either by reduction of vertical normal stresses at high tide or by the increase of shear stresses from sub-shelf ocean currents during falling tide. Event magnitudes are not related to the length of the preceding quiescent period, suggesting significant viscous dissipation within the till.},

Evidence that the major scabland rivers and the flooded Columbia were hundreds of feet deep exists in (1) gravel and boulder bars more than 100 feet high in mid-channels, (2) subfluvial cataract cliffs, alcoves, and plunge pools hundreds of feet in vertical dimension, (3) back-flooded silts high on slopes of preglacial valleys tributary to the scabland complex, and (4) the delta at Portland. Climatic oscillations of the Cordilleran ice sheet produced a succession of Lake Missoulas. Following studies by the writer, later investigators have corrected the Montana glacial record with recurrent scabland floods by soil profiles and a glacial and loessial stratigraphy, and have approximately dated some events by volcanic ash layers, peat deposits, and an archaeological site.

abstract = {Ice sheets are expected to shrink in size as the world warms, which in turn will raise sea level. The West Antarctic ice sheet is of particular concern, because it was probably much smaller at times during the past million years when temperatures were comparable to levels that might be reached or exceeded within the next few centuries. Much of the grounded ice in West Antarctica lies on a bed that deepens inland and extends well below sea level. Oceanic and atmospheric warming threaten to reduce or eliminate the floating ice shelves that buttress the ice sheet at present. Loss of the ice shelves would accelerate the flow of non-floating ice near the coast. Because of the slope of the sea bed, the consequent thinning could ultimately float much of the ice sheet$\backslash$$\backslash$textquoterights interior. In this scenario, global sea level would rise by more than three metres, at an unknown rate. Simplified analyses suggest that much of the ice sheet will survive beyond this century. We do not know how likely or inevitable eventual collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet is at this stage, but the possibility cannot be discarded. For confident projections of the fate of the ice sheet and the rate of any collapse, further work including the development of well-validated physical models will be required.},

abstract = {Deposits preserved on peaks in the southern Peruvian Andes are evidence for past glacial fluctuations and, therefore, serve as a record of both the timing and magnitude of past climate change. Moraines corresponding to the last major expansion of ice on Nevado Coropuna date to 20-25 ka, during the last glacial maximum. We reconstructed the snowline at Coropuna for this period using a combined geomorphic-numeric approach to provide a first-order estimate of the magnitude of late-Pleistocene climate change. Our reconstructions show that snowline was approximately 550-770m lower during the last glacial maximum than during the late Holocene maximum, which ended in the 19th century, and ?750mlower than today. While these values are similar to data from nearby Nevado Solimana, reconstructions from the neighbouring peak of Nevado Firura reveal a smaller snowline depression, suggesting the glacial response to climate forcing in the tropics is strongly influenced by non-climatic factors. These data constitute some of the first directly dated palaeo-snowline data from the arid tropics and suggest that the magnitude of the last glaciation in at least parts of the tropical Andes was similar to late-Pleistocene events at higher latitudes.},
