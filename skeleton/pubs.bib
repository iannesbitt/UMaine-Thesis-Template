abstract = {Post-Laurentide Ice Sheet erosion and re-deposition has had a significant influence on the geomorphology of New England. Anthropogenic activities such as forestry, farming, and construction of infrastructure such as dams and associated lake reservoirs, has further contributed to near surface changes. Unfortunately, these surface dynamics are difficult to constrain, both in space and time. One analog that can be used to estimate erosion and deposition, lake basin sedimentation, is typically derived from lake bottom sediment core samples. Reliance on core records assumes that derived sedimentation rates are representative of the broader watershed, despite being only a single point measurement. Geophysical surveys suggest that this assumption can be highly erroneous and unrepresentative of an entire lake basin. Herein, we conducted ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and side-scan sonar (SSS) surveys of multiple lakes in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont which are representative of different basin types to estimate sedimentation rates since Laurentide retreat. Subsequent age constraints from cores on multiple GPR-imaged horizons could be used to refine estimates of sedimentation rate change caused by evolving physical, biological, and chemical processes that control erosion, transport, and re-deposition. This presentation will provide a summary of GPR and SSS data collection methods, assumptions and limitations, structural and surficial interpretations, and key findings from multiple lake basins in New England. Results show that GPR and SSS are efficient, cost effective, and relatively accurate tools for helping to constrain lake erosion and deposition processes.},

abstract = {As the largest ocean basin, the Pacific helps to set the global climate state, since its circulation affects mean ocean properties, air-sea partitioning of carbon dioxide, and the distribution of global oceanic poleward heat transport. There is evidence that during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) the subarctic Pacific contained a better-ventilated, relatively fresh intermediate water mass above {\~{}}2000 m that may have formed locally. The source and spatial extent of this water mass is not known, nor do we know how formation of this water mass varied during Pleistocene glaciations with different orbital and ice sheet boundary conditions. Here we present a 0.5 My multi-species benthic stable isotope record from Site U1345 (1008 m) on the northern Bering slope and a 1.0 My record from U1339 (1868 m) from the Umnak Plateau in the southeastern basin. We find that the relatively well-ventilated low-$\delta$18O intermediate water reaches 1000 m in the Bering Sea during MIS2, but that the hydrographic divide between this water mass and poorly-ventilated deep water was shallower than 1000 m for earlier glaciations. We also compare Bering Sea piston core and IODP Expedition 323 Uvigerina data from the Holocene and LGM with the modern hydrography, and to previously published profiles from the Okhotsk Sea and Emperor Seamounts. We find that the carbon and oxygen stable isotope signatures of well-ventilated water in the Bering and Okhotsk Seas are distinct, suggesting that there may have been intermediate water formation in both basins during the LGM.},

abstract = {The critical zone in alpine and subalpine headwaters areas delivers drinking water to urban corridors near mountainous areas of North America. Snowmelt runoff from alpine areas typically accounts for over 80{\%} of annual flow, but water budgets are not well quantified nor well understood in detail. Redistribution of snow by wind, the difficulty of estimating water losses from sublimation and evapotranspiration, and groundwater gains and losses associated with unconsolidated subsurface material make streamflow and water budget measurements challenging. We investigate two adjacent catchments, Martinelli and Saddle, both about 0.25km2at {\~{}}3500m, on Niwot Ridge in the Colorado Front Range. Nearby Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) monitoring stations indicate mean annual precipitation is between 1210 and 950mm. Mean annual runoff is {\~{}}310mm at Martinelli and {\~{}}230mm at Saddle, based on 12 and 28 years of gaging records, respectively. Saddle basin is not fed by an extensive seasonal snowpack, but records indicate ablation-season discharge is still closely related to snowmelt in the basin. Martinelli shelters a {\~{}}6m thick snowpatch in 8 ha of the basin, even in a low snow year. During much of the ablation season, snowpack mass density ($\rho$) is 0.5g cm-3 and ablation rates are {\~{}}100mm day-1. Since vegetation is shallow-rooted or nonexistent in Martinelli, evapotranspiration (ET) may not be a major factor. Saddle is more heavily vegetated, but only the lower reaches are wooded; ET may be as much as 260mm. Runoff during 2012 was {\~{}}270mm yr-1 at Martinelli and {\~{}}35mm at Saddle. By monitoring snowpack area changes and longitudinal discharge, we were able to demonstrate that at low flow at least 30{\%} of snowmelt discharge at Martinelli and over 50{\%} at Saddle becomes subsurface flow and is unrecorded by the gages. We believe similar hydrologic budgeting can be applied to a wide range of small alpine catchments with similar “losing stream” characteristics.},
