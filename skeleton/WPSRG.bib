abstract = {Defining critical source areas (CSAs) of diffuse pollution in agricultural catchments depends upon the accurate delineation of hydrologically sensitive areas (HSAs) at highest risk of generating surface runoff pathways. In topographically complex landscapes, this delineation is constrained by digital elevation model (DEM) resolution and the influence of microtopographic features. To address this, optimal DEM resolutions and point densities for spatially modelling HSAs were investigated, for onward use in delineating CSAs. The surface runoff framework was modelled using the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) and maps were derived from 0.25m LiDAR DEMs (40 bare-earth points m−2), resampled 1m and 2m LiDAR DEMs, and a radar generated 5m DEM. Furthermore, the resampled 1m and 2m LiDAR DEMs were regenerated with reduced bare-earth point densities (5, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 points m−2) to analyse effects on elevation accuracy and important microtopographic features. Results were compared to surface runoff field observations in two 10km2 agricultural catchments for evaluation. Analysis showed that the accuracy of modelled HSAs using different thresholds (5{\%}, 10{\%} and 15{\%} of the catchment area with the highest TWI values) was much higher using LiDAR data compared to the 5m DEM (70–100{\%} and 10–84{\%}, respectively). This was attributed to the DEM capturing microtopographic features such as hedgerow banks, roads, tramlines and open agricultural drains, which acted as topographic barriers or channels that diverted runoff away from the hillslope scale flow direction. Furthermore, the identification of ‘breakthrough' and ‘delivery' points along runoff pathways where runoff and mobilised pollutants could be potentially transported between fields or delivered to the drainage channel network was much higher using LiDAR data compared to the 5m DEM (75–100{\%} and 0–100{\%}, respectively). Optimal DEM resolutions of 1–2m were identified for modelling HSAs, which balanced the need for microtopographic detail as well as surface generalisations required to model the natural hillslope scale movement of flow. Little loss of vertical accuracy was observed in 1–2m LiDAR DEMs with reduced bare-earth point densities of 2–5 points m−2, even at hedgerows. Further improvements in HSA models could be achieved if soil hydrological properties and the effects of flow sinks (filtered out in TWI models) on hydrological connectivity are also considered.},

abstract = {Over the past 50 years considerable progress has been made in understanding the impacts of urban development on river processes and forms. Such advances have occurred as urban population growth has accelerated around the world. Using a compilation of research results from more than 100 studies conducted in a range of areas (58 addressing morphological change), this paper describes how urbanization has transformed river landscapes across Earth's surface, emphasizing the distribution of impacts in a global comparative context. Urban development induces an initial phase of sediment mobilization, characterized by increased sediment production (on the order of 2-10 times) and deposition within channels, followed by eventual decline that couples with erosion from increased runoff to enlarge channels. Data from humid and temperate environments around the world indicate that channels generally enlarge to 2-3 times and as much as 15 times the original size. Although research has emphasized temperate environments, recent studies of tropical areas indicate a tendency for channel reduction resulting from strong sediment erosion and deposition responses because of intense precipitation and highly weathered soils. Embryonic research in arid environments further suggests variable river responses to urbanization that are characterized by rapid morphological change over short distances. Regardless of location, the persistence of the sediment production phase varies from months to several years, whereas several decades are likely needed for enlarging channels to stabilize and potentially reach a new equilibrium. Urbanizing streams pose particular challenges for management given an inherent changing nature. Successful management requires a clear understanding of the temporal and spatial variations in adjustment processes. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {* While there is an increasing emphasis in terrestrial ecology on determining the influence of the area that surrounds habitat patches (the landscape ‘matrix') relative to the characteristics of the patches themselves, research on these aspects in running waters is still rather underrepresented. * Here we outline conceptual foundations of matrix ecology for stream and river ecosystems (‘riverscapes'). We discuss how a hierarchical, patch-based perspective is necessary for the delineation of habitat patches and the surrounding matrix, through which we may identify two classes of habitat edges in riverscapes (i.e. edges between the terrestrial–aquatic interface and edges within streams). * Under this conceptual framework, we discuss the role of the matrix in influencing between-patch movement, and resource quality and quantity within and among habitat patches in riverscapes. We also review types of empirical and modelling approaches which may advance our understanding of fragmentation effects in these systems. * We identify five key challenges for understanding fragmentation and matrix effects more completely: (i) defining populations and their status (i.e. quantifying the demographic contribution of habitat patches to metapopulation dynamics), (ii) scaling from metapopulations to metacommunities (particularly searching for generalities in species responses to landscape heterogeneity), (iii) scaling from metacommunities to metaecosystems (i.e. exploring the interactive role of the terrestrial–aquatic and within-stream matrix effects on the flow of material and energy at the network scale), (iv) understanding temporal dynamics in matrix permeability and (v) revealing the utility of different patch and matrix representations for modelling connectivity relationships. * Fragmentation of habitats is a critical issue in the conservation and management of stream networks across spatial scales. Although the effects of individual barriers (e.g. dams) are well documented, we argue that a more comprehensive patch–matrix landscape model will improve our understanding of fragmentation effects and improve management in riverscapes.},

abstract = {Recent developments in zoogeomorphology in combination with the increasing interest of ecologists in ecosystem engineering by organisms initiated considerable research on the impact of running water (i.e., lotic) animals (and other organisms) on fluvial bed sediments and the transport of solids. This research provided multiple evidence from field and laboratory observations and experiments that many species among mammals, amphibians, fish, insects, crustaceans, mollusks, and worms engineer bed sediments of running waters with diverse mechanistic "tools", thereby perturbing or consolidating the sediments in many types of running waters across continents, seasons, habitat types, particle sizes, and discharge levels (baseflow vs. flood). Furthermore, many animals modify the bed-sediment engineering by plants (algae, larger macrophytes, riparian vegetation). Modeling effects of bioturbating lotic animals across species and relatively simple environmental conditions (in mesocosms) provided highly significant results (P-range: {\textless}10 -6-{\textless}10 -15) for nine sediment variables describing baseflow and flood-induced sediment transport as well as sediment surface modifications. For example, bioturbator biomass and/or algal abundance in combination with physical variables, such as baseflow shear stress or gravel size, explained between {\~{}}70 and {\~{}}90{\%} of the variability in sediment responses such as the overall baseflow sediment transport and, as a result of the baseflow sediment-surface engineering by the animals, the flood-induced gravel or sand transport. Confronting these seemingly encouraging experimental results with real world conditions, however, illustrates considerable problems to unravel the complexity of biotic and physical factors that vary temporally and interfere/interact non-linearly in a patchy pattern in small parts of real river beds, where baseflow bed-sediment engineering by lotic animals prevents or fosters mass erosion during subsequent floods. Despite these complications, these problems must be solved, as bioturbators such as crayfish and bioconsolidators such as silk-spinning caddisflies may locally modify (i) rates of transport of fluvial sediments over three orders of magnitude and (ii) frequencies of mass transport events over five orders of magnitude. The fastest way to identify promising subsequent research routes in this field would be through a variety of abundance manipulations of lotic organisms (animals and plants having different mechanistic sediment-engineering abilities) in real rivers in combination with a simple approach to assess the critical shear stress in situ for varying types of sediments. This would require joint research by fluvial geomorphologists, hydrologists, and ecologists. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The Connecticut River historically represented the southernmost extent of the North American range of At-lantic salmon (Salmo salar), but the native population was extirpated 200 years ago by dam construction. An extensive restoration effort has relied upon stock transfers from more northerly rivers, especially the Penobscot River (Maine). Recent work has shown differences in age structure between donor and derivative populations. Here we focus on a re-lated life-history trait, the timing of the adult migration. We examined 23 years of migration timing data collected at two capture locations in the Connecticut River drainage. We found that both dates of first capture and median capture dates have shifted significantly earlier by about 0.5 days{\textperiodcentered}year –1 . To conclude whether this is a consequence of local ad-aptation or a coast-wide effect, we also quantified changes in migration timing of more northerly stocks (in Maine and Canada). We found that the changes in migration timing were not unique to the Connecticut River stock and instead observed coherent patterns in the shift towards earlier peak migration dates across systems. These consistent shifts are correlated with long-term changes in temperature and flow and may represent a response to global climate change.

However, if all factors are taken into account properly, economic benefits generated by sustainable use of ecosystem services (such as water regulation, carbon sequestration, air- and water-purification, natural resources, recreational benefits, and aesthetic and spiritual values) usually exceed the costs of investing in ecosystem restoration and conservation. In this article, an overview is given of the full socio-economic value of ecosystems, the costs of the loss of ecosystem services and benefits of investing in restoring this “natural capital”. It is briefly discussed how to turn part of this value into real money based on payments, or other incentive-mechanisms, for conservation, restoration and sustainable use of these ecosystems and their services.},

abstract = {Landscapes in southeastern Australia have changed dramatically since the spread of European colonisation in the 19th century. Due to widespread forest clearance for cultivation and grazing, erosion and sediment yields have increased by a factor of more than 150. In the 20th century, erosion and sediment yield were reduced again due to an increasing vegetative cover. Furthermore, during the last decades, thousands of small farm dams were constructed to provide drinking water for cattle. These dams trap a lot of sediment, thereby further reducing sediment delivery from hillslopes to river channels. Changes in sediment delivery since European colonisation are documented in sediment archives. Within this study, these changing rates in hillslope erosion and sediment delivery were modelled using a spatially distributed erosion and sediment delivery model (WATEM/SEDEM) that was calibrated for Australian ecosystems using sediment yield data derived from sedimentation rates in 26 small farm dams. The model was applied to the Murrumbidgee river basin (30,000??km2) under different land-use scenarios. First, the erosion and sediment yield under pre-European land-use was modelled. Secondly, recent land-use patterns were used in the model. Finally, recent land-use including the impact of farm dams and large reservoirs was simulated. The results show that the WATEM/SEDEM model is capable of predicting the intensity of the geomorphic response to changes in land-use through time. Changes in hillslope erosion and hillslope sediment delivery rates are not equal, illustrating the non-linear response of the catchment. Current hillslope sediment supply to the river channel network is predicted to be 370{\%} higher compared to the pre-European settlement period, yet farm dams have reduced this back to 2.5 times the pre-19th century values. The role of larger reservoirs is even more important as they have reduced the current sediment supply downstream to their pre-European values, thus completely masking the increased hillslope erosion rates from land-use change. However, the model does so far not include valley widening and sediment storage in river systems. Therefore, modelled rates of sediment delivery are lower than observed values. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Linking environmental flow dam release rules to environmental variables has potential to link the flow variability of a regulated stream to the environmental forces acting on the catchment. A technique is developed to examine a range of release rules related to gauged tributary inflows and optimize these with respect to total water release volumes and other criteria. A model is created consisting of three parts: (1) a Dam Release Event Generator, which generates dam releases according to a set of rules, (2) a simple routing model using linear transforms and derived time-series for ungauged tributary inflows, (3) an algorithm to analyse the output time-series and produce statistics on the environmental flows. This model is run for a range of rule parameters within a parameter space. The results showed that multiple strategies might be capable of achieving the required targets but that some of these may be more robust in the face of climate variability than others. Significant water savings can result from the use of the technique. However. the results also highlight the limitations of the way environmental flows are currently stipulated and point towards a new generation of environmental flows. The technique is applied to environmental flow targets in the Thomson River catchment, Victoria, Australia. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley L Sons, Ltd.},

Because of the size and shape of this structure, the ECF will alter local flowhydraulic conditions and isolate local discharges and intakes from free interaction with the open water of the harbour. To investigate the impact and functionality of the ECF, a three- dimensional (3D) hydraulic model was adopted in this study. The model was verified against vertical velocity profiles measured with an acoustic doppler current profiler in the study region. Results of the verification reveal that under the driving force of wind, the best agreement between simulated and measured currents occurs in the surface layer. Considering the complex nature of the hydraulic conditions in the harbour, the model performs reasonably well. Overall, the model should provide a useful tool considering and comparing hydraulic con- ditions under different ECF configurations and the existing condition.

abstract = {Water resource managers seeking to optimize stream ecosystem services and abstractions of water from watersheds need an understanding of the importance of land use, physical and climatic characteristics, and hydrography on different low flow components of stream hydrographs. Within 33 USGS gaged watersheds of southern New England, we assessed relationships between watershed variables and a set of low flow parameters by using an information-theoretical approach. The key variables identified by the Akaike Information Criteria (AIC) weighting factors as generating positive relationships with low flow events included percent stratified drift, mean elevation, drainage area, and mean August precipitation. The extent of wetlands in the watershed was negatively related to low flow magnitudes. Of the various land use variables, the percentage of developed land was found to have the highest importance and a negative relationship on low flow magnitudes, but was less important than wetlands and physical and climatic features. Our results suggest that management practices aimed to sustain low flows in fluvial systems can benefit from attention to specific watershed features. We draw attention to the finding that streams located in watersheds with high proportions of wetlands may require more stringent approaches to withdrawals to sustain fluvial ecosystems during drought periods, particularly in watersheds with extensive development and limited deposits of stratified drift.},

abstract = {The synthesis of artificial landforms is complementary to geomorphic analysis because it affords a reflection on both the characteristics and intrinsic formative processes of real world conditions. Moreover, the applied terminus of geomorphic theory is commonly manifested in the engineering and rehabilitation of riverine landforms where the goal is to create specific processes associated with specific morphology. To date, the synthesis of river topography has been explored outside of geomorphology through artistic renderings, computer science applications, and river rehabilitation design; while within geomorphology it has been explored using morphodynamic modeling, such as one-dimensional simulation of river reach profiles, two-dimensional simulation of river networks, and three-dimensional simulation of subreach scale river morphology. To date, no approach allows geomorphologists, engineers, or river rehabilitation practitioners to create landforms of prescribed conditions. In this paper a method for creating topography of synthetic river valleys is introduced that utilizes a theoretical framework that draws from fluvial geomorphology, computer science, and geometric modeling. Such a method would be valuable to geomorphologists in understanding form-process linkages as well as to engineers and river rehabilitation practitioners in developing design surfaces that can be rapidly iterated. The method introduced herein relies on the discretization of river valley topography into geometric elements associated with overlapping and orthogonal two-dimensional planes such as the planform, profile, and cross section that are represented by mathematical functions, termed geometric element equations. Topographic surfaces can be parameterized independently or dependently using a geomorphic covariance structure between the spatial series of geometric element equations. To illustrate the approach and overall model flexibility examples are provided that are associated with mountain, lowland, and hybrid synthetic river valleys. To conclude, recommended advances such as multithread channels are discussed along with potential applications. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The St. Johns dam was constructed in 1901 on the Sandusky River at river mile 50.2 in southern Seneca County, Ohio, in the Eastern Corn Belt Plains ecoregion. The dam spanned approximately 150 feet, was 7 feet high, and created an impoundment 8 miles long. Following a decision to remove the dam, a shallow breach was made in the top of the dam at one end in March 2003, and the entire structure was removed on 17 November 2003. As a measure of the impact of removal of the dam on the biological communities of the river, the response of the macroinvertebrate community was investigated. Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (OEPA) methods for measuring biological quality in Ohio rivers were employed in this study. The methods involve placing artificial substrates (modified Hester-Dendy samplers) in the river to be colonized by macroinvertebrates to provide quantitative information. Qualitative sampling of natural substrates is performed to provide information on overall taxonomic diversity. The data are applied to ten metrics to derive a score for the Invertebrate Community Index (ICI). The ICI score provides a rating of biological quality based on expectations for reference streams in that ecoregion. Hester-Dendy samplers were colonized at three sites in the impounded reach of the Sandusky River in October and November 2003 and were recovered from the river the day the dam was removed. No qualitative sampling was accomplished because of high water conditions. Those sites and four additional sites were sampled both quantitatively and qualitatively in the summers of 2004 and 2005. Relatively few macroinvertebrates sensitive to degraded stream conditions were present at the three sites in the impoundment prior to dam removal, but after removal their numbers were higher and their proportional contribution to the macroinvertebrate community was similar to that at the other four sites. Similarly, the proportion of macroinvertebrates highly tolerant of degraded conditions declined markedly at the three sites following dam removal. On the basis of ICI scores, the macroinvertebrate community within the impoundment before dam removal was rated “Fair” (ICI scores from 20 to 24) at all three sites and thereby failed to meet the Warmwater Habitat (WWH) criterion (ICI = 36 or higher) for macroinvertebrates established by OEPA as the goal for the Sandusky River. OEPA had rated one of those sites (Walnut Grove) as “Poor” in 2001. In summer 2004, nine months after dam removal, that site was rated “Fair”, and in summer 2005 it was rated “Good”. In 2004, the two sites immediately upstream of the former dam were rated “Good” (west side, ICI = 44) and “Exceptional” (east side, ICI = 48), and a fourth site within the former impoundment near its most upstream extent was rated “Good”. Thus, three of the four sites in the former impoundment met the WWH criterion. A site below the former dam and two sites upstream of the impoundment were rated “Good” in 2004 and six of the seven sites met the criterion for “Exceptional Warmwater Habitat” in 2005. The results from 2004 indicate that the biological quality of the river in the formerly impounded reach adjusted rapidly to the changes in habitat quality that resulted from removal of the dam and that the once again free-flowing reach of the river developed a macroinvertebrate community similar to those present upstream and downstream of the former impoundment. The samples collected in 2005 confirmed the 2004 findings and revealed the presence of an exceptional macroinvertebrate community throughout most of the study reach.},

abstract = {Deeper consideration of the meaning and relevance of habitat is necessary and inevitable as interdisciplinary river science reveals the interactive nature of the relation between fluvial environments and the organisms that live in them. Following some embellishment of Lapointe's critique of ‘habitat' we illustrate this interaction by reviewing the role of animals, particularly fish (including salmonids) and benthic invertebrates, as geomorphological agents in gravel-bed rivers. As an example of the detailed laboratory and field experiments that are required to understand animal impacts on gravel-bed rivers, we report results from our own work with signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus), which demonstrate the influence that small animals can have on bed sediment characteristics and particle mobility. These include experiments designed to link laboratory findings to field situations and to evaluate the impact of conspecific behavioural interactions on gravel particle movement. The widespread distribution and high densities of small geomorphological actors, like crayfish, in gravel-bed rivers suggest that extremely large quantities of energy are collectively expended in modifying river bed sediments and near-bed hydraulics. In turn, there is the potential for reach and catchment scale geomorphological impacts that are as yet undiscovered and unquantified. We present a conceptual model that summarises the links between animal activities and sediment fluxes in gravel-bed rivers that can guide much-needed empirical investigations of the mechanisms and consequences of fish and invertebrate behaviours for gravel-bed river geomorphology.},

abstract = {Hierarchical and branching river networks interact with dynamic watershed disturbances, such as fires, storms, and floods, to impose a spatial and temporal organization on the nonuniform distribution of riverine habitats, with consequences for biological diversity and productivity. Abrupt changes in water and sediment flux occur at channel confluences in river networks and trigger changes in channel and floodplain morphology. This observation, when taken in the context of a river network as a population of channels and their confluences, allows the development of testable pre- dictions about how basin size, basin shape, drainage density, and network geometry interact to regulate the spatial distribution ofphysical diversity in channel and riparian attributes throughout a river basin. The spatial structure of river networks also regulates how stochastic watershed distur- bances influence the morphology and ages of fluvial features found at confluences.},

abstract = {Geomorphic controls on ecohydrological connections, while implicit in processes such as the derivation of transpired water from alluvial aquifers, have not been systematically investigated. In this article we test the hypothesis that geomorphic setting is an important control on groundwater-sourced riparian evapotranspiration (ET) through a statistical investigation of 30 years of daily flow data, monthly precipitation data, and semimonthly satellite images at fourteen 1-km-long river reaches representing a range of geomorphic settings in the semiarid landscape of New Mexico, USA. We focus on correlations between vegetation greenness (as a surrogate for vigor and transpiration rates), interannual variability in flow and rainfall characteristics, and valley metrics such as width, slope, and concavity. Sites were considered individually and in groups based on classification as perennial or intermittent. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to distill related metrics into significant, uncorrelated, interpretable, underlying variables. Components were interpreted in the same manner as a factor analysis and were found to include overall magnitude of greenness, within-summer variability of greenness, overall wetness, rain vs. flow dominance, snowmelt vs. monsoon dominance, and mountain vs. basin geomorphic setting, among others. To broadly test the hypothesis that geomorphology affects the relationship between wetness and greenness, best subset regressions were constructed for the full range of sites and groups using all wetness and geomorphic components as potential predictor variables and greenness metrics as response variables. From our analysis we draw two main conclusions: (1) including geomorphic parameters provides new information that is nonredundant with precipitation and flow parameters in predicting vegetation extent and vigor. The parameters, especially curvature, may indicate causal processes, such as increased soil moisture availability on concave surfaces with convergent flow paths, or they may provide correlative information on the groundwater setting (gaining vs. losing). (2) When considering groups of sites, the dominance of precipitation over stream flow in delivering moisture was a predictor of high greenness; but this was not the case for any individual sites. This indicates that while greener communities developed in sites with greater average precipitation, at any single site the vegetation was able to adapt to either local precipitation or streamflow delivery of moisture in a given year and only the magnitude of the moisture delivered affected vegetation vigor. These findings emphasize the versatility of riparian vegetation to utilize soil moisture in convergent geomorphic settings or wet time periods, moisture that may otherwise tend to evaporate.},

abstract = {Hydropower projects are rapidly expanding across lowland Amazonia, driving the conversion of large tracts of once-continuous forests into archipelagos embedded within a vast open-water matrix. Forest vertebrate populations thus become stranded in habitat islands, with their persistence governed by a combination of species life-history traits, habitat patch, and landscape context. We investigate the patterns of species extinction of 34 arboreal and terrestrial vertebrate species within three continuous forest sites and 37 land-bridge islands within one of the largest South American hydroelectric reservoirs, based on a combination of camera trapping, line-transect censuses, sign surveys, and armadillo burrow counts. Forest area was the best predictor of species persistence, so we classified all species into three levels of vulnerability to habitat insularization, with most species defined as 'area-sensitive'. However, island occupancy was decisively determined by individual species traits, with wide-ranging species and poor dispersers showing high local extinction rates. We detected higher island occupancy rates of large vertebrate species compared to other Neotropical fragmented forest landscapes, suggesting that this is critically attributed to the absence of hunting pressure at Balbina. Nevertheless, most terrestrial and arboreal species have been driven to local extinction within the vast majority of islands, which have been largely defaunated. We predicted species composition across all 3546 islands within the reservoir, indicating that only ???2{\%} of all islands continue to harbour at least 75{\%} of all species. To minimise loss of vertebrate diversity, future hydroelectric dam projects in lowland tropical forests, if unavoidable, should consider their geographic location and landscape structure to maximise both island size and landscape connectivity, and set aside strictly protected reserves within reservoir areas.},

abstract = {Global biodiversity in river and riparian ecosystems is generated and maintained by geographic variation in stream processes and fluvial disturbance regimes, which largely reflect regional differences in climate and geology. Extensive construction of dams by humans has greatly dampened the seasonal and interannual streamflow variability of rivers, thereby altering natural dynamics in ecologically important flows on continental to global scales. The cumulative effects of modification to regional-scale environmental templates caused by dams is largely unexplored but of critical conservation importance. Here, we use 186 long-term streamflow records on intermediate-sized rivers across the continental United States to show that dams have homogenized the flow regimes on third- through seventh-order rivers in 16 historically distinctive hydrologic regions over the course of the 20th century. This regional homogenization occurs chiefly through modification of the magnitude and timing of ecologically critical high and low flows. For 317 undammed reference rivers, no evidence for homogenization was found, despite documented changes in regional precipitation over this period. With an estimated average density of one dam every 48 km of third- through seventh-order river channel in the United States, dams arguably have a continental scale effect of homogenizing regionally distinct environmental templates, thereby creating conditions that favor the spread of cosmopolitan, nonindigenous species at the expense of locally adapted native biota. Quantitative analyses such as ours provide the basis for conservation and management actions aimed at restoring and maintaining native biodiversity and ecosystem function and resilience for regionally distinct ecosystems at continental to global scales.},

abstract = {We explore the role of lakes in carbon cycling and global climate, examine the mechanisms influencing carbon pools and transformations in lakes, and discuss how the metabolism of carbon in the inland waters is likely to change in response to climate. Furthermore, we project changes as global climate change in the abundance and spatial distribution of lakes in the biosphere, and we revise the estimate for the global extent of carbon transformation in inland waters. This synthesis demonstrates that the global annual emissions of carbon dioxide from inland waters to the atmosphere are similar in magnitude to the carbon dioxide uptake by the oceans and that the global burial of organic carbon in inland water sediments exceeds organic carbon sequestration on the ocean floor. The role of inland waters in global carbon cycling and climate forcing may be changed by human activities, including construction of impoundments, which accumulate large amounts of carbon in sediments and emit large amounts of methane to the atmosphere. Methane emissions are also expected from lakes on melting permafrost. The synthesis presented here indicates that (1) inland waters constitute a significant component of the global carbon cycle, (2) their contribution to this cycle has significantly changed as a result of human activities, and (3) they will continue to change in response to future climate change causing decreased as well as increased abundance of lakes as well as increases in the number of aquatic impoundments.},

Survival of fry stocked at low density to underyearling and yearling part- was 42 ± 2.5{\%} and 19 ± 1.3{\%}, respectively. Density of underyearling part produced from fry stocked at low density was not significantly different from the 10.6 ± 1.5 parr produced from fry stocking at high density (mean, 117 ± 16.5/100 m2). However, the 4.0 ± 0.8 yearling part-/100 m2 produced was significantly lower at high stocking density. Survival to underyearling and yearling parr at high stocking density was 11.6 ± 2.0{\%} and 4.6 ± 1.0{\%}, respectively, both significantly lower than survival rates at low stocking density. Thus, low-density stocking produced equal or greater densities of parr with much higher survival rates. Estimated smolt production from low-density fry stocking (with the assumption of a part—to-smolt overwinter survival rate of 65{\%}) was about 4.0 smolts/100 m2; this is equivalent to a fry-to-smolt survival rate of 13{\%}. Results from stocking fed and unfed fry were similar, except fed fry were more likely to produce yearling smolts. Managers of restoration and enhancement programs with limited broodstock, eggs, or incubation space should be able to produce more smolts by stocking fry at lower densities over wider areas without affecting per-unit-area smolt production.},

abstract = {Previous studies of vegetation establishment in dam removal sites have shown that natural vegetation community establishment is highly variable and frequently includes species often considered undesirable in restorations. In this article, we examined two case studies where dam removal sites were planted with native species following dam removal in an effort to promote native species establishment and exclude invasive species. Some planted species established soon after the dam removals, but surveys four years later showed a decline in planted species and an increase in non-native species. In both cases, reed canary- grass (Phalaris arundinacea) became well estab- lished in the interval between surveys. A seedbank analysis of sediments from four intact reservoirs with similar physical charac- teristics to the removal sites showed that reed canarygrass is not active in the seedbank. This suggests that there may be an opportunity to exclude it from dam removal sites if manage- ment actions are taken after removal. How- ever, in these two cases, planting following removal did not exclude reed canarygrass and few of the planted species persisted four years after planting.},

abstract = {The Murray-Darling Basin is Australia's food bowl and home to many iconic water bodies that are culturally and ecologically highly valued. The recent Millennium Drought (from mid-1990s to 2009) was the most severe hydrological drought since records started in the late 19th century. It severely impacted on the basin and for many acted as a wake-up call. To address the ongoing declines in water resources and environmental conditions and to prepare the region for climate change, Australia's Governments are currently attempting to introduce a new comprehensive, and integrated approach to the management of the basin's water resources. In this paper, long-term time series of climate, hydrological and environmental data are used to analyze how compounding stresses have gradually affected the hydrological system and its services. Major hydroclimatic stresses considered in this paper include salinity, water use, droughts, and climate change. Other, more localized or minor stresses exist (groundwater extraction, farm dams, afforestation, bush fires, cyanobacterial blooms and pollutants) and are reviewed more briefly. The history of water policy and planning shows that Government actions have been strongly influential on the basin. A shift in the strategic goals from water development to the protection and restoration of environmental assets is noticeable since the mid 1990s. Median climate change projections by 2030 indicate smaller reductions in rainfall and runoff than those observed during the recent Millennium Drought, but have a relatively high uncertainty attached to them. The use of regional approaches to reduce that uncertainty, such as statistical downscaling, points to a sizeable decline in rainfall by the end of the century. Most climate projections used for planning consider greenhouse emission scenarios that have smaller global emission trends than the one observed over the last decade. Other, 'less optimistic' scenarios have to be considered for long-term water planning and food security. Compounding all these stresses, is the naturally high hydroclimatic variability of this semi-arid region, that may have been insufficiently considered during previous water development and planning efforts. Successful water planning will need to balance cultural and ecological values with food production, account for high natural variability and uncertainty in climate change projections, learn from past mistakes and be cognizant of future hydrological changes. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa and Apalachicola-Flint-Chattahoochee River basins' water usage has evolved from power generation to multiple uses. Recreation and housing have become increasingly valuable components. Changing use patterns imply changing resource values. This study focused on six Alabama reservoirs, using contingent valuation questions in on-site, telephone, and mail surveys to estimate impacts on lakefront property values, recreational expenditures, and preservation values for scenarios of permanent changes to reservoir water quantity. As summer full-pool duration decreased, lakefront property value decreased, and as duration increased, property values increased, but at a lesser rate. Similar findings occurred for winter drawdown alternatives. Permanent one-foot reductions in summer full-pool water levels resulted in a 4 to 15 percent decrease in lakefront property values. Recreational expenditures decreased 4 to 30 percent for each one-foot lowering of reservoir water levels. Current nonusers of the six reservoirs showed strong preferences for protecting study reservoirs with willingness to pay values of {\$}47 per household or approximately {\$}29 million for the entire six-reservoir watershed basin area.

abstract = {For nearly twenty years in the western United States, billions of dollars have been spent to recover anadromous salmon species listed under the federal Endangered Species Act. Broad support and participation from the private and public sectors is needed to address the limiting factors to salmon viability, especially the improvement of stream and watershed health. However, in today's fiscal and political climate it is more important than ever to demonstrate the multiple ways that conservation work benefits not just the environment but also our economy. This paper examines the employment and economic impacts of watershed restoration expenditures made in Oregon from 2001-2010, making use of multipliers developed by the University of Oregon's Ecosystem Workforce Program. We collected data on salmon habitat restoration projects from a statewide database system, the Oregon Watershed Restoration Inventory, and grouped project activities according to the University of Oregon restoration employment and economic multiplier categories. To determine the total direct, indirect, and induced economic output and employment resulting from restoration investments, we multiplied the total project investment in each category of restoration work by the relevant multiplier. We then summed the total economic activity by project type to arrive at a total per county and the state. We found that a total of US{\$}411.4 million was invested in 6,740 watershed restoration projects throughout the state of Oregon from 2001 to 2010, resulting in the generation of between {\$}752.4 million and {\$}977.5 million in economic output and 4,628 to 6,483 jobs. The jobs created by restoration activities are located mostly in rural areas, in communities hard hit by the economic downturn. Restoration activities bring a range of employment opportunities for people in construction, engineering, natural resource sciences, and other fields. The job creation potential of restoration activities compared with investments in other sectors of the economy is favorable. Restoration also stimulates demand for the products and services of local businesses such as plant nurseries, heavy equipment companies, and rock and gravel companies. Unlike in other economic sectors, restoration jobs can't be outsourced to distant locations, so these dollars tend to stay in the local and state economy. Restoration investments also continue to accrue and pay out over time. Long-term improvements in habitat create enduring benefits, from enhanced recreational and fishing opportunities to the provision of critical ecosystem services. These findings are good news to the people of Oregon and there is tremendous opportunity to extend and replicate this work to other regions. Being able to effectively communicate the interdependencies of ecosystems and economies is critical to addressing the immense challenges of the 21st century. As long as we continue to frame trade-offs in simplistic terms like jobs versus the environment, we will be relegated to making incremental change. Whether our aim is the recovery of wild salmon in the Western United States or the abatement of greenhouse gas emissions; alternative models for economic development need to be redoubled. We have found that quantifying and presenting the economic benefits of watershed restoration reframes the conversation and opens doors to new alliances. {\textcopyright} Licence Creative Commons.},

abstract = {Landscapes in southeastern Australia have changed dramatically since the spread of European colonisation in the 19th century. Due to widespread forest clearance for cultivation and grazing, erosion and sediment yields have increased by a factor of more than 150. In the 20th century, erosion and sediment yield were reduced again due to an increasing vegetative cover. Furthermore, during the last decades, thousands of small farm dams were constructed to provide drinking water for cattle. These dams trap a lot of sediment, thereby further reducing sediment delivery from hillslopes to river channels. Changes in sediment delivery since European colonisation are documented in sediment archives. Within this study, these changing rates in hillslope erosion and sediment delivery were modelled using a spatially distributed erosion and sediment delivery model (WATEM/SEDEM) that was calibrated for Australian ecosystems using sediment yield data derived from sedimentation rates in 26 small farm dams. The model was applied to the Murrumbidgee river basin (30,000??km2) under different land-use scenarios. First, the erosion and sediment yield under pre-European land-use was modelled. Secondly, recent land-use patterns were used in the model. Finally, recent land-use including the impact of farm dams and large reservoirs was simulated. The results show that the WATEM/SEDEM model is capable of predicting the intensity of the geomorphic response to changes in land-use through time. Changes in hillslope erosion and hillslope sediment delivery rates are not equal, illustrating the non-linear response of the catchment. Current hillslope sediment supply to the river channel network is predicted to be 370{\%} higher compared to the pre-European settlement period, yet farm dams have reduced this back to 2.5 times the pre-19th century values. The role of larger reservoirs is even more important as they have reduced the current sediment supply downstream to their pre-European values, thus completely masking the increased hillslope erosion rates from land-use change. However, the model does so far not include valley widening and sediment storage in river systems. Therefore, modelled rates of sediment delivery are lower than observed values. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Climate change can promote harmful cyanobacteria blooms in eutrophic waters through increased droughts or flooding. In this paper, we explore how water-level fluctuations affect the occur-rence of cyanobacterial blooms, and based on the observations from case studies, we discuss the options and pitfalls to use water-level fluctuations for lake and reservoir management. A drawdown in summer causes an increase in retention time and increased water column nutrient concentrations and temperature of shallow water layers, which may lead to severe cyanobacterial blooms. This effect can potentially be counteracted by the positive response of submerged macrophytes,  which  compete  for  nutrients  with cyanobacteria, with a higher chance of cyanobacterial blooms under eutrophic conditions. The balance between dominance by submerged macrophytes or cyanobacteria is temperature sensitive with stronger positive  effects  of  drawdown  as  inhibition  of cyanobacterial blooms expected in colder climates. Complete drying out reduces the amount of cyanobac-teria in the water column after refilling, with lower water nutrient concentrations, lower fish biomass, lower abundance of cyanobacteria, higher trans-parency, and higher cover of submerged plants compared to lakes and reservoirs that did not dry out. Water-level rise as response to flooding has contrasting effects on the abundance of cyanobacteria depending on water quality. We conclude that water-level fluctuation management has potential to mitigate cyanobacterial blooms. However, the success will depend strongly on ecosystem properties, including morphometry, sediment type, water retention time, quality of inlet water, presence of submerged vegeta-tion or propagules, abundance of fish, and climate. $\backslash$r$\backslash$nKeywords: Climate change - Cyanobacteria -  Drawdown - Flooding - Lake - Macrophyte - Phytoplankton},

abstract = {Dam-influenced streambank morphology has not been studied extensively in rivers in deglaciated landscapes with high densities of colonial-era milldams. Fluvial restoration in the eastern U.S. often focuses on understanding pre-Colonial floodplain processes. Recent work by Walter and Merritts (2008a) in the Piedmont of the U.S. mid-Atlantic region suggests milldams significantly impact sedimentation by creating surfaces composed of post-dam legacy sediment that are often abandoned by the river and function as fill terraces. I analyze channel morphology and sedimentation patterns upstream of two breached dams on the Sheepscot River in mid-coastal Maine using lidar digital elevation models, historical aerial photographs, radiocarbon dating, and hydraulic modeling. In the past several decades, observable channel morphologic changes occurred at the two study sites: Maxcy's Mills dam (built in 1809, it was 2-m high and breached in the late 1950s), and at Head Tide dam (built in the 1760s, it is 4-m high and was partially breached in 1952). The Sheepscot River has a native population of Atlantic salmon, which is a federally listed endangered species. Understanding the existence and transport of legacy sediment has become an important component of habitat restoration efforts in the region. The goal of this investigation is to determine the extent and morphologic function of legacy sediment in order to better understand how historical dam sites affect channel morphology and sediment transport in a post-glacial, low-gradient river system. Field and remote sensing analyses indicate that surfaces (up to 2.65 m high) composed of mud and sand function as floodplains 1 km upstream from Head Tide dam and surfaces 90 cm high continue 2.5 km upstream from Maxcy's Mills. Analysis of seven radiocarbon dates from pieces of tree bark sampled from the stratigraphy (58-187 cm below the surface) of the two study sites suggest up to 1.8 m of sediment upstream of the two study sites was deposited within the past 300 years and is therefore a legacy of the dams. Quantification of the total volume of stored legacy sediment is on the same scale as volumes observed in the mid-Atlantic Piedmont region, leading to the conclusion that post-glacial rivers in northern New England store milldam sediment in similar fashion to streams analyzed in the Walter and Merritts (2008a) study.},

abstract = {River restoration through dam removal provides an opportunity to investigate the changing nature of environmental conflicts and politics in long-humanized landscapes. In New England, where over 14,000 dams fragment the region's rivers, dam removals are often highly contested. This is due, in part, to how the intertwined roles of history, identity, and aesthetics coalesce to create attachment to place and inspire the defense of dammed landscapes. Dam removal provides a useful lens to consider the following: How do the historical and geographical contingencies of this region shape and alter conflicts over dam removal in specific ways? In instances where conflicts emerge, what do the conflicts reveal about the politics of ecological restoration in highly altered landscapes? We use a political ecology approach to reveal how complex cultural dynamics, competing interpretations of science and the environment, micropolitics, and the role of multiple actors generate and shape conflicts over dam removal. We show that the historical geography of New England influence conflicts over removal in important ways, particularly with regard to the roles of aesthetics and identity in landscapes that are characterized largely by consumptive as opposed to productive uses. Our findings also suggest that restoration in long-humanized landscapes will embroil new constellations of human and nonhuman actors, requiring attention to the political and cultural, as well as the ecological, dimensions of restoration. This paper contributes to research on the political and social dimensions of dam removal, as well as to research at the nexus of ecological restoration and environmental politics.},

abstract = {Sediment transport is regarded as an abiotic process driven by geophysical energy, but zoogeomorphological activity indicates that biological energy can also fuel sediment movements. It is therefore prudent to measure the contribution that biota make to sediment transport, but comparisons of abiotic and biotic sediment fluxes are rare. For a stream in the UK, the contribution of crayfish bioturbation to suspended sediment flux was compared with the amount of sediment moved by hydraulic forcing. During base flow periods, biotic fluxes can be isolated because nocturnal crayfish activity drives diel turbidity cycles, such that nighttime increases above daytime lows are attributable to sediment suspension by crayfish. On average, crayfish bioturbation contributed at least 32{\%} (474 kg) to monthly base flow suspended sediment loads; this biotic surcharge added between 5.1 and 16.1 t (0.21 to 0.66 t km−2 yr−1) to the annual sediment yield. As anticipated, most sediment was moved by hydraulic forcing during floods and the biotic contribution from baseflow periods represented between 0.46 and 1.46{\%} of the annual load. Crayfish activity is nonetheless an important impact during baseflow periods and the measured annual contribution may be a conservative estimate because of unusually prolonged flooding during the measurement period. In addition to direct sediment entrainment by bioturbation, crayfish burrowing supplies sediment to the channel for mobilization during floods so that the total biotic effect of crayfish is potentially greater than documented in this study. These results suggest that in rivers, during base flow periods, bioturbation can entrain significant quantities of fine sediment into suspension with implications for the aquatic ecosystem and base flow sediment fluxes. Energy from life rather than from elevation can make significant contributions to sediment fluxes.},

More specifically, the neoclassical economic approach is seen to require a belief in utilitarianism while many individuals may operate on the basis of a deontological or rights-based approach to decision-making. The concern with this relationship arises from the use of the cost–benefit analysis approach to environmental policy and the specific application of the contingent valuation method. Evidence is found to support the view that environmentalists choose to operate on a rights-based approach which rejects the relative welfare arguments of economics and positively attributes compensation to future generations for environmental damages. This implies that the contingent valuation of environmental attributes will lead to values which are biased towards technocentric optimists and against the environmental movement. In terms of policy, environmental management on the basis of totalling economic values is liable to be undemocratic because of the systematic exclusion of a section of the general public.},

abstract = {Forced riffle-pools occur in gravel-bed rivers where a large nonalluvial element leads to local scour and deposition. To manage rivers where this type of morphology is found and to specify restoration measures that mimic this process, more field data on sediment mobility in forced riffle-pools is needed. The objectives of this study are to describe the spatial variability of sediment mobility and deposition in a developing forced riffle- pool and to use high-resolution flowvelocity measurements to explain the observed dynamics. The field site is a forced riffle-pool in Moras Creek, a 6-m-wide gravel-bed stream with a 1.2{\%} bed slope in Quebec, Canada. Topography and the movement of sediment particles equipped with Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags are surveyed through a series of competent floods. Bed shear stress is estimated from near-bed measurements of time-averaged velocity and turbulent kinetic energy. The sediment transport regime of the creek is characterized by partial mobility, exponential distributions of path lengths, and a negative relation between particle size and path length. Full mobility occurs in the center of the pool and over the exit slope where flowis accelerated from the constriction of flowduring two events above the bankfull discharge. Partial mobility occurs during the same events over the entrance slope to the pool. Lateral gradients of deposition and mobility suggest that the majority of sediment in motion is routed over the side bar at the entrance to the pool. High levels of turbulence intensity that occur as a result of flow deceleration may explain the removal of finer sediments from the head of the pool. {\textcopyright}},

After the restructuring of the Brazilian electricity sector, a series of laws, decrees and resolutions were developed with the purpose of regulating the sector in favor of SHPs. In 2001, the number of SHPs in Brazil was 303 with an installed capacity of 855 MW. Over the years, with the changes in the sector and, in 2010, the number of buildings has reached 387, with an installed capacity of 3428 MW. Today, they are 475 SHPs in operation with the generation capacity in the country, around 4799 MW, representing 3.49{\%} of all Brazilian energy matrix. It is estimated that in 2020 the installed capacity will be approximately 6500 MW, but there is more potential available in the country for SHPs, that has great technical and environmental characteristics. It is concluded that more attention must be given by the government policies of the electricity sector to reach in the future the full the potential of SHPs available in Brazil.},

abstract = {The mountain rivers of the Indian Himalaya possess a vast potential for hydropower generation. After decades of comparatively modest development recent years have seen a major intensification in the construction of new hydropower dams. Although increasingly portrayed as a form of renewable energy generation, hydropower development may lead to extensive alterations of fluvial systems and conflicts with resource use patterns of local communities. To appraise and reduce adverse effects is the purpose of statutory Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) and corresponding mitigation plans. However, in the light of ambitious policies for hydropower expansion conventional approaches of environmental assessment are increasingly challenged to keep up with the intensity and pace of development. This paper aims to explore the systemic limitations of environmental assessment for hydropower development in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. Based on a qualitative methodology involving interviews with environmental experts, document reviews and field observations the study suggests that the current practice of constraining EIAs to the project level fails to address the larger effects of extensive hydropower development. Furthermore, it is critically discussed as to what extent the concept of Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) might have the potential to overcome existing shortcomings. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Lurking below the twin concepts of connectivity and disconnectivity are their first, and in some ways, richer cousins: continuity and discontinuity. In this paper we explore how continuity and discontinuity represent fundamental and complementary perspectives in fluvial geomorphology, and how these perspectives inform and underlie our conceptions of connectivity in landscapes and rivers. We examine the historical roots of continuum and discontinuum thinking, and how much of our understanding of geomorphology rests on contrasting views of continuity and discontinuity. By continuum thinking we refer to a conception of geomorphic processes as well as geomorphic features that are expressed along continuous gradients without abrupt changes, transitions, or thresholds. Balance of forces, graded streams, and hydraulic geometry are all examples of this perspective. The continuum view has played a prominent role in diverse disciplinary fields, including ecology, paleontology, and evolutionary biology, in large part because it allows us to treat complex phenomena as orderly progressions and invoke or assume equilibrium processes that introduce order and prediction into our sciences. In contrast the discontinuous view is a distinct though complementary conceptual framework that incorporates non-uniform, non-progressive, and non-equilibrium thinking into understanding geomorphic processes and landscapes. We distinguish and discuss examples of three different ways in which discontinuous thinking can be expressed: 1) discontinuous spatial arrangements or singular events; 2) specific process domains generally associated with thresholds, either intrinsic or extrinsic; and 3) physical dynamics or changes in state, again often threshold-linked. In moving beyond the continuous perspective, a fertile set of ideas comes into focus: thresholds, non-equilibrium states, heterogeneity, catastrophe. The range of phenomena that is thereby opened up to scientific exploration similarly expands: punctuated episodes of cutting and filling, discretization of landscapes into hierarchies of structure and control, the work of extreme events. Orderly and progressive evolution towards a steady or ideal state is replaced by chaotic episodes of disturbance and recovery. Recent developments in the field of geomorphology suggest that we may be on the cusp of a new paradigm that recognizes that both continuous and discontinuous processes and mechanisms play a role in fluvial processes and landscape evolution with neither holding sway over the other and both needed to see rivers as they are.},

abstract = {Although hydropower is a source of low-carbon energy, without careful consideration and management, dams have the potential to degrade river ecosystems and the goods and services they provide to society. Today, a broad range of hydropower interests and stakeholders are seeking approaches to hydropower development and operation that are more environmentally and socially sustainable. The Penobscot River Restoration Project (‘the Project') illustrates that basin-scale approaches can provide a broader set of solutions for balancing energy and riverine environmental resources than can be achieved at the scale of individual projects. The Penobscot basin is the largest in Maine and historically supported culturally and economically significant populations of migratory fish. These migratory fish populations declined dramatically following the construction of a series of hydropower dams on the main stem river and major tributaries in the early 20th century. The Project, negotiated between a power company (PPL Corporation) and a coalition including the Penobscot Indian Nation, resource agencies, and nongovernmental conservation organizations, features the removal of two main stem dams on the lower Penobscot and improved fish passage at the dams that remain. Because of various capacity and/or operational changes, power production will be increased at the remaining dams and total hydropower energy production from the basin will be maintained or increase slightly. The Project is expected to expand considerably the proportion of the basin accessible to migratory fish and contribute to significant increases in fish populations. The Project illustrates that a basin-scale approach can potentially yield more comprehensive solutions for sustainable hydropower than can be achieved at the project scale, and we recommend that such large-scale planning processes can improve the sustainability of both regulatory licensing of existing dams as well as the planning of future dams in regions undergoing the expansion of water-management infrastructure.},

Removal of the dam would open {\textgreater} 40 km of suitable upstream habitat for aquatic species, but there are concerns about contaminated sediment in the reservoir. In cooperation with the Ohio EPA, sediment cores were evaluated for 18 metals and 138 organic contaminants. Geochronology was provided by (CS)-C-137 and Pb-210, recognition of historical flood horizons, and stratigraphic correlation to 14 previously dated cores. Seven metals (Al, As, Cr, Fe, Ni, Pb, Zn) exceeded Threshold Effect Levels (TEL) and four others (Cd, Cu, Hg, Mn) were close. Only Fe exceeded the Probable Effect Levels (PEL) although Al, As and Ni were close. Most metal concentrations were uniform throughout the cores (when normalized for A/ content), with the exception of upward increases in Cr and Se, and downward increases in Mn. DDT residues (DDD and DDE) exceeded PEL values between 50-125 cm in the cores (corresponding to mid-1940s to late-1970s). Total petroleum hydrocarbons (C-15 to C-24) showed moderate levels (1-9 mg/kg) of petroleum pollution. Finally, PAH con centrations reach TEL values only below the redox zone (pre-1950) in the sediments. Possibly this is an historical archive of a 757,000-liter toluene spill reported in 1988 on the Sandusky River upstream of the reservoir. Removal of the dam would require dredging or release downstream of 0.35 million m(3) of sediment to re-establish the channel of the Sandusky River. Sediment contamination in the Ballville reservoir involves concentrations less than or equal to those in existing Lake Erie sediment, and the effects would be diluted by mixing with downstream or nearshore Lake Erie sediments.},

abstract = {Using daily discharge data from the USGS, we analyzed how hydrologic regimes vary with land use in four large hydrologic regions that span a gradient of natural land cover and precipitation across the continental United States. In each region we identified small streams (contributing areab282 km2) that have continuous daily streamflow data. Using a national database, we characterized the composition of land cover of the watersheds in terms of aggregate measures of agriculture, urbanization, and least disturbed (“natural”). We calculated hydrologic alteration using 10 ecologically-relevant hydrologic metrics that describe magnitude, frequency, and duration of flow for 158 watersheds within the Southeast (SE), Central (CE), Pacific Northwest (NW), and Southwest (SW) hydrologic regions of the United States. Within each watershed, we calculated percent cover for agriculture, urbanized land, and least disturbed land to elucidate how components of the natural flow regime inherent to a hydrologic region is modified by different types and proportions of land cover. We also evaluated how dams in these regions altered the hydrologic regimes of the 43 streams that have pre- and post-dam daily streamflow data. In an analysis of flow alteration along gradients of increasing proportion of the three land cover types, we found many regional differences in hydrologic responses. In response to increasing urban land cover, peak flows increased (SE and CE), minimum flows increased (CE) or decreased (NW), duration of near-bankfull flows declined (SE, NW) and flow variability increased (SE, CE, and NW). Responses to increasing agricultural land cover were less pronounced, as minimum flows decreased (CE), near-bankfull flow durations increased (SE and SW), and flow variability declined (CE). In a second analysis, for three of the regions, we compared the difference between least disturbed watersheds and those having either N15{\%} urban and N25{\%} agricultural land cover. Relative to natural land cover in each region, urbanization either increased (SE and NW) or decreased (SW) peak flows, decreased minimum flows (SE, NW, and SW), decreased durations of near-bankfull flows (SE, NW, and SW), and increased flow variability (SE, NW, and SW). Agriculture had similar effects except in the SE, where near-bankfull flow durations increased. Overall, urbanization appeared to induce greater hydrologic responses than similar proportions of agricultural land cover in watersheds. Finally, the effects of dams on hydrologic variation were largely consistent across regions, with a decrease in peak flows, an increase in minimum flows, an increase in near- bankfull flow durations, and a decrease in flow variability.We use this analysis to evaluate the relative degree to which land use has altered flow regimes across regions in the US with naturally varying climate and natural land cover, and we discuss the geomorphic and ecological implications of such flow modification.We end with a consideration of what elements will ultimately be required to conduct a more comprehensive national assessment of the hydrologic responses of streams to land cover types and dams. These include improved tools for modeling hydrologic metrics in ungauged watersheds, incorporation of high-resolution geospatial data to map geomorphic and hydrologic drivers of stream response to different types of land cover, and analysis of scale dependence in the distribution of land-use impacts, including mixed land uses. Finally, ecological and geomorphic responses to human alteration of land cover will have to be calibrated to the regional hydroclimatological, geologic, and historical context in which the streams occur, in order to determine the degree to which stream responses are region-specific versus geographically independent and broadly transferable.},

abstract = {Documenting ecosystem improvement after dam removal is integral to obtaining mitigation credit for river restoration. To document the effects of the November 2003 removal of the St. John's dam, substrate and morphology were mapped along the Mexico Bridge Reach, 7 – 9 miles upstream. Geographically referenced field data were collected in Summer 2003, Fall 2004, and Summer 2005. Combining preferred substrates (boulder, cobble, and gravel) with preferred morphology (runs and glides) in GIS derived potential spawning habitat for each year. Substrate changes occur more rapidly than morphological changes, driving change in spawning habitat. Preliminary findings of pre- and post-dam removal surveys show the following: 1) substrate consisting of boulder and cobble comprised 1{\%} of the substrates and remained essentially constant over the three-year study; 2) cobble and gravel substrate, increased from 30{\%} of the available acreage in 2003 to 47{\%} in 2004, but then decreased to 26{\%} in 2005; 3) sand and mud substrate decreased from 69{\%} in 2003 to 53{\%} in 2004, but increased to 73{\%} in 2005. Boulder, cobble and gravel, the prime spawning substrates, moved through this reach in 2004 and was most likely transported downstream in 2005. This accounts for a relative increase in sand and mud in 2005. These surveys document redistribution of potential spawning habitat for smallmouth bass and walleye after dam removal. These habitat changes along with hydrodynamic modeling, macroinvertebrate sampling, and fish sampling performed by collaborators will help establish the evolution of ecosystem restoration after dam removal, possibly indicating that one year of post-removal monitoring is insufficient to characterize ecosystem improvement along a single reach.},

abstract = {The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) represents a transformation of the guidelines for water quality assessment and monitoring across all EU Member States. At present, it is widely accepted that the WFD requires holistic and multidisciplinary ecological approaches by integrating multiple lines of evidence. Within the scope of the WFD, the scientific community identified clear opportunities to take advantage of an ecotoxicological line of evidence. In this context, ecotoxicological tools, namely biomarkers and bioassays, were proposed to contribute to the integration of the chemical and biological indicators, and thus to provide an overall insight into the quality of a water body. More than one decade after the publication of the WFD, we reviewed the studies that have attempted to integrate ecotoxicological tools in the assessment of surface water bodies. For this purpose, we reviewed studies providing an ecological water status assessment through more conventional community based approaches, in which biomarkers and/or bioassays were also applied to complement the evaluation. Overall, from our review emerges that studies at community level appear suitable for assessing the ecological quality of water bodies, whereas the bioassays/biomarkers are especially useful as early warning systems and to investigate the causes of ecological impairment, allowing a better understanding of the cause-effect-relationships. In this sense, community level responses and biomarkers/bioassays seem to be clearly complementary, reinforcing the need of combining the approaches of different disciplines to achieve the best evaluation of ecosystem communities' health. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Numerous velocity profiles were measured along a riffle-pool sequence for three different flow conditions. For each flow condition (ranging from. baseflow to about 2/3 of bankfull depth), ten to fifteen velocity profiles were measured along the same transect. The objectives of the study were: (i) to differentiate between components of bed roughness and shear stress attributed to surface friction and large-scale bed undulations, and (ii) to investigate the effects of fluctuating discharges on the mean vertical flow structure in pools and riffles. No previous attempts have been made to investigate scales of bed roughness from velocity profiles along riffle-pool sequences and to determine how near-bed velocity gradients change with increasing flow discharge. At low flows (and as expected), riffles are characterized by higher near-bed velocity gradients than pools. Similarly, average bed shear stresses, as determined from measurements of flow depth and energy gradient, indicate a greater resistance and bed shear stress in riffle sections. Invariably, however, local shear stresses as determined from near-bed velocity gradients in pools and in riffles are much smaller than reach averages estimated from measurements of depth and slope. The shape of spatially averaged velocity profiles changes as discharges increases. The difference in terms of near-bed velocities b'etween pools and riffles decreases as discharge increases which suggests that a velocity reversal may occur at or near bankfull. Further away from the bed surface, velocity differences between pools and riffles do remain significant. Finally, the curvature of the velocity profiles is more significant at high flows and surface roughness is maximized when flow conditions are intermediate, perhaps a result of increasing density of small-scale sedimentary structures.},

abstract = {The effects of river regulation on bottomland tree communities in western North America have generated substantial concern because of the important habitat and aesthetic values of these communities. Consideration of such effects in water management decisions has been hampered by the apparent variability of responses of bottomland tree communities to flow alteration. When the relation between streamflow and tree establishment is placed in a geomorphic context, however, much of that variability is explained, and prediction of changes in the tree community is improved. The relation between streamflow and establishment of bottomland trees is conditioned by the dominant fluvial process or processes acting along a stream. For successful establishment, cottonwoods, poplars, and willows require bare, moist surfaces protected from disturbance. Channel narrowing, channel meandering, and flood deposition promote different spatial and temporal patterns of establishment. During channel narrowing, the site requirements are met on portions of the bed abandoned by the stream, and establishment is associated with a period of low flow lasting one to several years. During channel meandering, the requirements are met on point bars following moderate or higher peak flows. Following flood deposition, the requirements are met on flood deposits high above the channel bed. Flood deposition can occur along most streams, but where a channel is constrained by a narrow valley, this process may be the only mechanism that can produce a bare, moist surface high enough to be safe from future disturbance. Because of differences in local bedrock, tributary influence, or geologic history, two nearby reaches of the same stream may be dominated by different fluvial processes and have different spatial and temporal patterns of trees. We illustrate this phenomenon with examples from forests of plains cottonwood (Populus deltoides ssp. monilifera) along meandering and constrained reaches of the Missouri River in Montana.},

abstract = {1. This review focuses on the connectivity between river and groundwater ecosystems, viewing them as linked components of a hydrological continuum. Ecological processes that maintain the integrity of both systems and those that are mediated by their ecotones are evaluated. 2. The hyporheic zone, as the connecting ecotone, shows diverse gradients. Thus it can be characterized by hydrological, chemical, zoological and metabolic criteria. However, the characteristics of the hyporheic zone tend to vary widely in space and time as well as from system to system. The exact limits are difficult to designate and the construction of static concepts is inadequate for the representation of ecological processes. The hyporheic interstices are functionally a part of both the fluvial and groundwater ecosystems. 3. The permeability of the ecotone depends on the hydraulic conductivity of the sediment layers which, because of their heterogeneity, form many flowpath connections between the stream and the catchment, from the small scale of a single microhabitat to the large scale of an entire alluvial aquifer. Local up- and downwellings are determined by geomorphologic features such as streambed topography, whereas large-scale exchange processes are determined mainly by the geological properties of the catchment. Colmation—clogging of the top layer of the channel sediments—includes all processes leading to a reduction of pore volume, consolidation of the sediment matrix, and decreased permeability of the stream bed. Consequently, colmation can hinder exchange processes between surface water and groundwater. 4. Physicochemical gradients in the interstices result from several processes: (i) hyporheic flow pattern and the different properties of surface and groundwaters; (ii) retention, caused by the filtering effect of pore size and lithologic sorption as well as the transient storage of solutes caused by diminished water velocities; (iii) biogeochemical transformations in conjunction with local residence time. Each physicochemical parameter may develop its own vertical dynamics laterally from the active channel into the banks as well as longitudinally because of geomorphologic changes. 5. The river–groundwater interface can act as a source or sink for dissolved organic matter, depending on the volume and direction of flow, dissolved organic carbon concentrations and biotic activity. Interstitial storage of particulate organic matter is influenced mainly by grain size distribution and by spates involving bedload movement that may import or release matter, depending on the season. After initial transient and abiotic storage, hyporheic organic matter is mobilized and transformed by the biota Micro-organisms account for over 90{\%} of the community respiration. In subterranean waters most bacteria are attached to surfaces and remain in a biofilm. 6. Hyporheic interstices are functionally significant for phreatic and riverine metazoans because they act as a refuge against adverse conditions. The net flow direction exerts a dominant influence on interstitial colonization, but many other factors also seem to be important in structuring the hyporheos. 7. The hyporheic corridor concept emphasizes connectivity and interactions between subterranean and surface flow on an ecosystem level for floodplain rivers. It is a complementary concept to others which focus on surficial processes in the lateral and longitudinal dimensions. 8. The ecological integrity of groundwater and fluvial systems is often threatened by human activities: (i) by reducing connectivity; (ii) by altering exchange processes; and (iii) by toxic or organic contamination.},

abstract = {By constructing nitrogen (N) budgets from 1880 to 2002 for watersheds that have undergone urbanization, intensive agricultural specialization or experienced minimal change, we document an uneven timeline of increase in anthropogenic N inputs. N loading to the watersheds of the Lake Michigan Basin grew six-fold from 1880 to 2002, peaking in 1987. Human activities influenced N inputs as early as 1880, and the magnitude and timing of increase differed markedly across regions in accord with population growth, land use, and type of agriculture. The greatest increase occurred from 1950 to 1980, corresponding with rapidly accelerating use of artificial fertilizers, but increases in atmospheric deposition and shifting patterns in crop and livestock production also affected trends. Net anthropogenic N inputs have changed little since about 1980, showing a modest decline due to a leveling out of fertilizer use and greater export of animal feed and products. Using a model that predicts riverine N export from watershed N loadings and river discharge, we found that river TN fluxes from all tributaries increased approximately threefold from 1900 to 2000 but have stabilized or declined over the past two decades, consistent with national surveys that show near-constant or declining riverine TN concentrations. For the LMB, the past two decades has been a period of relative stasis in N inputs to its terrestrial systems and N export from watersheds. This retrospective analysis also points to the challenge of forecasting future trends in N budget terms, which can both increase and decline in response to policy and societal transitions.},

abstract = {Dams are ubiquitous in coastal regions and have altered stream habitats and the distribution and abundance of stream fishes in those habitats by disrupting hydrology, temperature regime and habitat connectivity. Dam removal is a common restoration tool, but often the response of the fish assemblage is not monitored rigorously. Sedgeunkedunk Stream, a small tributary to the Penobscot River (Maine, USA), has been the focus of a restoration effort that includes the removal of two low-head dams. In this study, we quantified fish assemblage metrics along a longitudinal gradient in Sedgeunkedunk Stream and also in a nearby reference stream. By establishing pre-removal baseline conditions and associated variability and the conditions and variability immediately following removal, we can characterize future changes in the system associated with dam removal. Over 2years prior to dam removal, species richness and abundance in Sedgeunkedunk Stream were highest downstream of the lowest dam, lowest immediately upstream of that dam and intermediate farther upstream; patterns were similar in the refer- ence stream. Although seasonal and annual variation in metrics within each site was substantial, the overall upstream-to-downstream pattern along the stream gradient was remarkably consistent prior to dam removal. Immediately after dam removal, we saw significant decreases in richness and abundance downstream of the former dam site and a corresponding increase in fish abundance upstream of the former dam site. No such changes occurred in reference sites. Our results show that by quantifying baseline conditions in a small stream before restoration, the effects of stream restoration efforts on fish assemblages can be monitored successfully. These data set the stage for the long-term assessment of Sedgeunkedunk Stream and provide a simple methodology for assessment in other restoration projects.

abstract = {Bear Brook Watershed in Maine (BBWM) consists of a pair of research watersheds, East Bear Brook (EBB) and West Bear Brook (WBB), Years of research and observations have shown both watersheds have high similarity in geographic and hydrologic characteristics; a simple comparison of hydrographs from these two watersheds further substantiates this similarity. The Object Watershed Link Simulation (OWLS) model was developed and used to simulate the hydrological processes within the BBWM. The OWLS model is a 3-dimensional, vector-based, visualized, physically-based distributed watershed hydrologic model. Simulation results not only provide a close examination of hydrologic processes within a watershed, but also dynamically visualize the processes of flow separations and Variable Source Areas (VSA), Results from flow separations suggest that surface flow from riparian area is the predominate component for the flood rising limb and that macropore flow from riparian area dominates during the falling limb. Soil matrix flow has little effect during flood period but is a persistent contributor to base flow. Results from VSA visualization demonstrate 3-D dynamic changes in surface flow distribution and suggest that downstream riparian areas are the major contributing area for peak flow. As water chemistry is highly relevant to the flow paths within a watershed, simulations have provided valuable information about source of stream flow and the water migration dynamics to support the study of watershed chemistry in the BBWM. More specific linkages between the chemistry behavior and the dynamic hydrologic processes should become the next simulation effort in the watershed study. There are many questions that art critical to watershed chemistry studies like: which flow component (surface flow, macropore flow, soil matrix flow) predominates during peak flows? How do the flow components distribute during a flood event? How do flow contributions differ between these two watersheds? Which portion of the watershed contributes the most to the peak flows? These questions remain unknown from previous observations and only can be addressed with a physically-based distributed model.},

Ultimately, the goal is to quantify the role of floodplains for partitioning water and sediment fluxes over the great fluvial basins of the world. SAR images are used to identify the type of surface (open water, inundated areas, forest) and, hence, the areas covered with water. Both radar altimetry data and in-situ hydrographic measurements yield water level time series. The basin of the Negro River, the tributary which carries the largest discharge to the Amazon River, was selected as a test site. By combining area estimates derived from radar images classification with changes in water level, variations of water volume (focusing on a seasonal cycle) have been obtained. The absence of relationship between water volume and inundated area, reflecting the diverse and widely dispersed floodplains of the basin, is one of the main result of this study. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Stream bathymetry is a critical variable in a number of river science applications. In larger rivers, bathymetry can be measured with instruments such as sonar (single or multi-beam), bathymetric airborne LiDAR, or acoustic doppler current profilers. However, in smaller streams with depths less than 2 meters, bathymetry is one of the more difficult variables to map at high-resolution. Optical remote sensing techniques offer several potential solutions for collecting high-resolution bathymetry. In this research, I focus on direct photogrammetric measurements of bathymetry using multi-view stereo photogrammetry, specifically Structure from Motion (SfM). The main barrier to accurate bathymetric mapping with any photogrammetric technique is correcting for the refraction of light as it passes between the two different media (air and water), which causes water depths to appear shallower than they are. I propose and test an iterative approach that calculates a series of refraction correction equations for every point/camera combination in a SfM point cloud. This new method is meant to address shortcomings of other correction techniques and works within the current preferred method for SfM data collection, oblique and highly convergent photographs. The multi-camera refraction correction presented here produces bathymetric datasets with accuracies of {\~{}}0.02{\%} of the flying height and precisions of {\~{}}0.1{\%} of the flying height. This methodology, like many fluvial remote sensing methods, will only work under ideal conditions (e.g. clear water), but it provides an additional tool for collecting high-resolution bathymetric datasets for a variety of river, coastal, and estuary systems.

Projects were selected randomly within the four most common project goals from a national database: in-stream habitat improvement, channel reconfiguration, riparian management, and water-quality improvement. Roughly half of the projects were implemented as part of a watershed management plan and had some advisory group. Monitoring occurred in 79{\%} of projects but often was minimal and seldom documented biological improvements. Baseline data for evaluation often relied on previous data obtained under regional monitoring programs using state protocols. Although 89{\%} of project contacts reported success, only 11{\%} of the projects were considered successful because of the response of a specific ecological indicator, and monitoring data were underused in project assessment. Estimates of ecological success, using three criteria from Palmer and others (2005), indicated that half or fewer of the projects were ecologically successful, markedly below the success level that project contacts self-reported, and sent a strong signal of the need for well-designed evaluation programs that can document ecological success.},

In this study, twelve monthly water balance models with different structures and various degree of complexity are compared in 153 catchments with different climatic conditions in China. Generally, the GR5M model has the best performance, followed by the GR2M and WBM model. We investigate the relations between model performance and catchment characteristics and find that the climatic characteristic of a catchment is the most important factor impacting model performance. The models have better performance in wet catchments than in dry catchments. Large differences of model performance exist in dry catchments and model users should pay attention to model selection in dry catchments. In addition, we analyze the model performances among different models and conclude that increasing the model complexity does not guarantee a better model performance. Simple models can achieve comparable or even better performance than complex models. For the monthly simulation of hydrological processes, a two-parameter model is sufficient to achieve a good result. Moreover, by comparing the impacts of evapotranspiration simulation and runoff generation simulation on model performance, we find that evapotranspiration simulation has limited influence on the model performance. We suggest model builders focus on runoff generation process rather than evapotranspiration process to improve the performance of a monthly hydrological model.},

abstract = {Lakes and reservoirs typically emit CO(2) to the atmosphere as a result of respiration in excess of primary production. For reservoirs, this respiration is often assumed to be primarily of benthic origin, associated with drowned vegetation and soils. This study took measurements from a young hydroelectric reservoir (Eastmain-1) in boreal Canada and nearby natural lakes to compare the rates of water column respiration and hypolimnetic CO(2) accumulation during a stratified period. Reservoir water column respiration rates were significantly higher than those in natural lakes, with surface means of 61.4 +/- 4.6 mg C m(-3) d(-1) in Eastmain-1 and 40.2 +/- 3 mg C m(-3) d(-1) in lakes and profundal means of 58.1 +/- 11 mg C m(-3) d(-1) in Eastmain-1 and 17.6 +/- 7.5 mg C m(-3) d(-1) in lakes. Reservoir hypolimnetic CO(2) accumulation rates were also higher than those in natural lakes, with means of 78.8 +/- 16 mg C m(-3) d(-1) in Eastmain-1 and 19.8 +/- 2.7 mg C m(-3) d(-1) in lakes. Our findings further indicate that the relative contribution of benthic respiration (estimated as the difference between hypolimnetic CO(2) accumulation and water column respiration) toward total net CO(2) production during stratified periods was similar in both aquatic systems (23{\%} in lakes, 27{\%} in Eastmain-1). By identifying the major role of the water column in the reservoir's CO(2) production, this study calls for a significant paradigm shift away from the common assumption that reservoir CO(2) emissions are predominantly the result of decaying vegetation in the benthic environment.},

abstract = {This study investigated the relationships between behavioural responses of Atlantic salmon Salmo salar smolts to saltwater (SW) exposure and physiological characteristics of smolts in laboratory exper-iments. It concurrently described the behaviour of acoustically tagged smolts with respect to SW and tidal cycles during estuary migration. Salmo salar smolts increased their use of SW relative to fresh water (FW) from April to June in laboratory experiments. Mean preference for SW never exceeded 50{\%} of time in any group. Preference for SW increased throughout the course of smolt development. Maximum continuous time spent in SW was positively related to gill Na + , K + -ATPase (NKA) activity and osmoregulatory performance in full-strength SW (measured as change in gill NKA activity and plasma osmolality). Smolts decreased depth upon reaching areas of the Penobscot Estuary where SW was present, and all fish became more surface oriented during passage from head of tide to the ocean. Acoustically tagged, migrating smolts with low gill NKA activity moved faster in FW reaches of the estuary than those with higher gill NKA activity. There was no difference in movement rate through SW reaches of the estuary based on gill NKA activity. Migrating fish moved with tidal flow during the passage of the lower estuary based on the observed patterns in both vertical and horizontal move-ments. The results indicate that smolts select low-salinity water during estuary migration and use tidal currents to minimize energetic investment in seaward migration. Seasonal changes in osmoregulatory ability highlight the importance of the timing of stocking and estuary arrival.},

abstract = {Human activities have greatly altered the nitrogen (N) cycle, accelerating the rate of N fixation in landscapes and delivery of N to water bodies. To examine relationships between anthropogenic N inputs and riverine N export, we constructed budgets describing N inputs and losses for 16 catchments, which encompass a range of climatic variability and are major drainages to the coast of the North Atlantic Ocean along a latitudinal profile from Maine to Virginia. Using data from the early 1990's, we quantified inputs of N to each catchment from atmospheric deposition, application of nitrogenous fertilizers, biological nitrogen fixation, and import of N in agricultural products (food and feed). We compared these inputs with N losses from the system in riverine export. The importance of the relative sources varies widely by catchment and is related to land use. Net atmospheric deposition was the largest N source ({\textgreater}60{\%}) to the forested basins of northern New England (e.g. Penobscot and Kennebec); net import of N in food was the largest source of N to the more populated regions of southern New England (e.g. Charles Blackstone); and agricultural inputs were the dominant N sources in the Mid-Atlantic region (e.g. Schuylkill {\&} Potomac). Over the combined area of the catchments, net atmospheric deposition was the largest single source input (31{\%}), followed by net imports of N in food and feed (25{\%}), fixation in agricultural lands (24{\%}), fertilizer use (15{\%}), and fixation ill forests (5{\%}). The combined effect of fertilizer use, fixation in crop lands, and animal feed imports makes agriculture the largest overall source of N. Riverine export of N is well correlated with N inputs, but it accounts for only a fraction (25{\%}) of the total N inputs. This work provides an understanding of the sources of N in landscapes, and highlights how human activities impact N cycling in the northeast region.},

abstract = {The State of Rivers and Dams in Maine is the second chapter in The State of Maine's Environment 2009, a report produced by the Environmental Policy Group in the Environmental Studies Program at Colby College in Waterville, Maine. This is the fifth State of Maine's Environment report published since 2004. The 31,752 miles of rivers and streams in Maine are important to Maine's economy, ecological health, and cultural heritage. Dams have shaped both the natural flows and the societal uses of rivers in Maine for over two centuries. Although no new dams have been built since 1986, remaining dams continue to have environmental and economic impacts. In this chapter we discuss the state of rivers and dams in Maine, focusing on the history of dams, their current status, and the growing trend of dam removal. We give particular attention to diadromous – or migratory – fish and how dams and dam removals affect their traditional migration routes. We conducted an extensive literature review and performed original analysis using Geographic Information Systems. This chapter shows that Maine's surface water quality is commendable, ranking number one in the U.S. We illustrate the growth of the number of dams in Maine over time, and investigate a boom in dam construction between 1875 and 1900. We also examine dam removal, a contentious topic, in light of the federal and state regulatory processes and the environmental benefits and drawbacks of dams. Finally, we analyze the historical habitat of 12 species of diadromous fish and find that 65{\%} of dams that have been removed in Maine, or are slated for removal in the near future, intersect the habitats of six or more species while less than 1{\%} of dams still standing intersect the habitats of six or more species . We conclude that while Maine's river health is in excellent condition, more can be done to allow diadromous fish populations renewed access to their historical habitat and spawning grounds. Although fish bypasses are feasible, only a small percentage of migrating fish find the necessary entrance. Dam removal is an increasing trend and should be considered as a viable option to restore diadromous fish habitat and spawning grounds. We offer several recommendations to increase river health and productivity, including the continued monitoring of river and stream health, a state-wide prioritization of dams to consider for fish bypass installation, and an increased emphasis on dam removal as a method for river restoration and public safety.},

abstract = {While the era of dam building is largely over in the United States, globally dams are still being proposed and constructed. The articles in this special issue consider many aspects and impacts of dams around the world. This paper examines dam removal and the measurement of the impacts of dams on local community property values. Valuable lessons may be found. In the United States, hundreds of small hydropower dams will come up for relicensing in the coming decade. Whether or not the licensees are renewed and what happens to the dams if the licenses expires is a subject of great debate. Dams are beginning to be removed for river restoration and fisheries restoration and these "end-of-life" decisions may offer lessons for countries proposing or currently building small (and large) hydropower dams. What can these restoration stories tell us? In this paper, we examine the effects of dams along the Penobscot River in Maine (USA) on residential property values. We compare the results to findings from a similar (but ex post dam removal) data set for properties along the Kennebec river in Maine, where the Edwards Dam was removed in 1999. The Penobscot River Restoration Project, an ambitious basin-wide restoration effort, includes plans to remove two dams and decommission a third along the Penobscot River. Dam removal has significant effects on the local environment, and it is reasonable to anticipate that environmental changes will themselves be reflected in changes in property values. Here we examine historical real estate transaction data to examine whether landowners pay a premium or penalty to live near the Penobscot River or near a hydropower generating dam. We find that waterfront landowners on the Penobscot or other water bodies in our study area pay approximately a 16{\%} premium for the privilege of living on the water. Nevertheless, landowners pay LESS to live near the Penobscot River than they do to live further away, contrary to the expectation that bodies of water function as real estate amenities and boost local property values. Results with respect to the effect of proximity to hydropower generating plants are equivocal. Homeowners pay a small premium for houses close to hydropower dams in our region, but the statistical significance of that result depends on the specific model form used to estimate the effect. Consideration of the social and economic impacts of dam removal-based river restoration can complement studies of the ecological impacts of the practice. Such studies help us understand the extent to which human society's subjective perception of value of aquatic ecosystems relates to objective measures of ecosystem health. The paper also illustrates how geographic information systems (GIS) can help inform these analyses. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We examined the community concordance among diatoms, macroinvertebrates and fish in minimally disturbed streams on four nested spatial scales (i.e., national, catchment, sub-catchment and mountain or lowland at sub-catchment scales) in Korea. The results, based on non-metric multidimensional scaling, showed that diatoms, macroinvertebrates and fish displayed consistent patterns that were strongly structured along an altitude gradient at the national scale. However, the responses to all other influential environmental factors differed by assemblages. The community composition of fish closely reflected the gradients of larger scale environmental factors (i.e., geographical and hydrological variables), whereas macroinvertebrates mainly reflected the changes at relatively finer environmental scales (e.g., hydrological variables and substrate composition). Diatoms showed relatively weak relationships with environmental variables except for the altitudinal gradient. Community concordance based on Protest was significant at four nested spatial scales, although most cases of community concordances were relatively weak. Fish and macroinvertebrates showed high concordance at the national and catchment scales, whereas macroinvertebrates and diatoms showed high concordance at smaller scales (i.e., mountain or lowland at sub-catchment). Finally, our study demonstrated that community concordance among diatoms, macroinvertebrates and fish would be different according to spatial scales and even in the same scales and that use of a representative taxon to assess ecological integrity should be applied with caution.},

abstract = {U.S. Department of the Interior is planning to remove two high dams (30 and 60 m) from the Elwha River, which will allow the river to erode sediment deposits in the reservoirs, and ultimately restore the river ecosystem. Fluvial sediment transport and deposition paradoxically represent ecological disturbance and restoration. A one-dimensional, movable boundary sediment-transport model was applied at a daily time step to simulate changes in river-bed elevations and particle-size distributions and concentrations of suspended sediment. The simulations included a three-year dam removal period and a four-year recovery period. Simulated concentrations of suspended sediment recover rapidly during the recovery period. Simulated bed elevation and particle-size distributions are stable for much of the river during the recovery period, but high flows periodically disturb the river bed, causing changes in river-bed elevation and particle-size distribution, especially during autumn, when summer/autumn chinook salmon are incubating in redds. Although the river bed will become increasingly stable after dam removal, episodic high flows will interrupt recovery trends. Productivity and diversity of the ecosystem may be lower because of excess sediment immediately after dam removal but should increase during recovery above current levels as the river. Monitoring of the recovery of the Elwha River ecosystem can target ecologically significant physical parameters indicating the transition from a sediment transport-limited state to a supply-limited state.},

abstract = {The phase of precipitation when it reaches the ground is a first-order driver of hydrologic processes in a watershed. The presence of snow, rain, or mixed-phase precipitation affects the initial and boundary conditions that drive hydrological models. Despite their foundational importance to terrestrial hydrology, typical phase partitioning methods (PPMs) specify the phase based on near-surface air temperature only. Our review conveys the diversity of tools available for PPMs in hydrological modeling and the advancements needed to improve predictions in complex terrain with large spatiotemporal variations in precipitation phase. Initially, we review the processes and physics that control precipitation phase as relevant to hydrologists, focusing on the importance of processes occurring aloft. There is a wide range of options for field observations of precipitation phase, but there is a lack of a robust observation networks in complex terrain. New remote sensing observations have the potential to increase PPM fidelity, but generally require assumptions typical of other PPMs and field validation before they are operational. We review common PPMs and find that accuracy is generally increased at finer measurement intervals and by including humidity information. One important tool for PPM development is atmospheric modeling, which includes microphysical schemes that have not been effectively linked to hydrological models or validated against near-surface precipitation-phase observations. The review concludes by describing key research gaps and recommendations to improve PPMs, including better incorporation of atmospheric information, improved validation datasets, and regional-scale gridded data products. Two key points emerge from this synthesis for the hydrologic community: (1) current PPMs are too simple to capture important processes and are not well validated for most locations, (2) lack of sophisticated PPMs increases the uncertainty in estimation of hydrological sensitivity to changes in precipitation phase at local to regional scales. The advancement of PPMs is a critical research frontier in hydrology that requires scientific cooperation between hydrological and atmospheric modelers and field scientists.},

abstract = {From headwaters to mouth, the physical variables within a river system present a con- tinuous gradient of physical conditions. This gradient should elicit a series of responses within the constituent populations resulting in a continuum of biotic adjustments and consistent patterns of loading, transport, utilization, and storage of organic matter along the length of a river. Based on the energy equilibrium theory of fluvial geomorphologists, we hypothesize that the structural and functional characteristics of stream conununities are adapted to conform to the most probable position or mean state of the physical system. We reason that producer and consumer communities characteristic of a given river reach become established in harmony with the dynamic physical conditions of the channel. In natural stream systems, biological communities can be characterized as forming a temporal continuum of synchronized species replacements. This continuous replacement functions to distribute the utilization of energy inputs over time. Thus, the biological system moves towards a balance between a tendency for efficient use of energy inputs through resource partitioning (food, substrate, etc.) and an opposing tendency for a uniform rate of energy processing throughout the year. We theorize that biological communities developed in natural streams assume processing strategies involving minimum energy loss. Downstream communities are fashioned to capitalize on upstream processing inefficiencies. Both the upstream inefficiency (leakage) and the downstream adjust- ments seem predictable. We propose that this River Continuum Concept provides a frame- work for integrating predictable and observable biological features of lotic systems. Implica- tions of the concept in the areas of structure, function, and stability of riverine ecosystems are discussed.},

Such “hydropeaking” is common worldwide, but its downstream impacts remain unclear. We evaluated the response of aquatic insects, a cornerstone of river food webs, to hydropeaking using a life history–hydrodynamic model. Our model predicts that aquatic-insect abundance will depend on a basic life-history trait—adult egg-laying behavior—such that open-water layers will be unaffected by hydropeaking, whereas ecologically important and widespread river-edge layers, such as mayflies, will be extirpated. These predictions are supported by a more-than-2500-sample, citizen-science data set of aquatic insects from the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon and by a survey of insect diversity and hydropeaking intensity across dammed rivers of the Western United States. Our study reveals a hydropeaking-related life history bottleneck that precludes viable populations of many aquatic insects from inhabiting regulated rivers.},

Following removal, channels eroded large quantities of fine sediment, resulting in deposition 3–5 km downstream. At one site (Baraboo River), upstream changes were rapid and included bed degradation, minimal bank erosion, and sediment deposition on channel margins and new floodplain. Sand was transported through the former impoundment and temporarily deposited downstream. At the second site (Koshkonong River), head-cut migration governed channel adjustments. A deep, narrow channel formed downstream of the head- cut, with negligible changes upstream of the head-cut. Fluvial changes were summarized in a conceptual channel evolution model that highlighted (1) similarities between adjustments associated with dam removal and other events that lower channel base-level, and (2) the role of reservoir sediment characteristics (particle size, cohesion) in controlling the rates and mechanisms of sediment movement and channel adjustment.},

Hydropower developers and operators desire tools to better anticipate mitigation requirements, while natural resource managers and regulators need tools to evaluate different mitigation scenarios and order effective mitigation. Here we sought to examine the feasibility of using a suite of multi-faceted explanatory variables within a spatially explicit modeling framework to fit predictive models for future environmental mitigation requirements at hydropower projects across the conterminous U.S. Using a database comprised of mitigation requirements from more than 300 hydropower project licenses, we were able to successfully fit models for nearly 50 types of environmental mitigation and to apply the predictive models to a set of more than 500 non-powered dams identified as having hydropower potential. The results demonstrate that mitigation requirements are functions of a range of factors, from biophysical to socio-political. Project developers can use these models to inform cost projections and design considerations, while regulators can use the models to more quickly identify likely environmental issues and potential solutions, hopefully resulting in more timely and more effective decisions on environmental mitigation.},

abstract = {Abstract  Catchment nitrogen (N) budgets are a valuable tool to assess relative magnitude of N inputs and predict losses via riverine export. However, a range of computational approaches may be chosen, potentially affecting the modeled relationship between inputs and exports. To determine the influence of various assumptions and computational details on the effectiveness of N input estimates in predicting riverine N export, we compared eight separate net anthropogenic N input budgets and one soils compartment budget for each of 18 Lake Michigan catchments. N input estimation methods that took into account seasonal fluctuations in livestock numbers and estimated crop N-fixation by legume yield rather than area harvested best predicted river N export. The average annual river export of N from the 18 catchments ranged from less than 300 kg N km−2 year−1 in forested areas to more than 800 kg-N km−2 year−1 in agricultural catchments and 1,580 kg-N km−2 year−1 in small urban catchments. Using the most effective model (R 2 = 0.95, median prediction error = 1.8{\%}) riverine N exports were found to account for 21{\%} of N inputs. Other methods predicted riverine N exports less well (R 2 = 0.61–0.73), bias was greater, and the fractional export of N inputs by rivers decreased to {\~{}}13{\%}. The soil N budget also was a less effective predictor of river export. This comparison demonstrates that N budgeting that incorporates more detailed description of agricultural N sources can substantially improve prediction of riverine N exports from catchments with a wide range of landscape characteristics.},

Among these parameters is the height of effective zero flow. Measured from the WGS84 ellipsoid used as reference, it is shown that the height of effective zero flow is a good proxy of the mean water depth from which bottom slope of the reaches can be computed and Manning roughness coefficients can be evaluated. Mean absolute difference lower than 1.1 m between estimated equivalent water depth and measured water depth indicates the good reliability of the method employed. We computed the free surface water slope from ENVISAT altimetry data for dry and rainy seasons. These profiles are in good agreement with the bottom profile derived from the aforementioned water depths. Also, the corresponding Manning coefficients are consistent with the admitted ranges for natural channels with important flows (superficial width {\textgreater}30.5 m [Chow, V.T., 1959.

abstract = {The proposed removal of Ballville Dam was assessed by (1) using a new Geographic Information Systems (GIS) based method for calculating reservoir sediment storage, (2) evaluating sediment properties and contamination from core data, and (3) assessing downstream impacts from sediment routing calculations. A 1903 (pre-dam) map was manipulated using GIS to recreate the reservoir bathymetry at time of dam construction and used in combination with a detailed 1993 bathymetric survey to calculate sediment volumes and thickness. Reservoir sediment properties and geochemistry were determined from 14 sediment vibracores. Annual sedimentation rates varied from 1.7 to 4.3 g/cm(2)/yr based on Cesium-137 (Cs-137) and Lead-210 (Pb-210) geochronology and dated flood layers. The pore fluid geochemistry (Ba, Co, Cu, Mn) of four cores showed surficial enrichments in Cu, while Co and Mn show secondary peaks within the sediments. GIS calculations showed that a designed channel through the former reservoir able to accommodate the 10 percent Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) would require removing approximately 0.35 million m(3) of sediment (27 percent of the reservoir fill), either by dredging at a cost of up to {\$}6.3 million or by releasing fine grained sediment downstream. A sediment routing model was applied for the critical 6 km downstream using four cross sections. The sediment routing model predicts that, for flows exceeding minimum Mean Daily Flow (1924 to 1998 data), greater than 90 percent of this sediment would be transported through downstream reaches into Lake Erie (Sandusky Bay).},

Autumn peaks were also observed in the gill Na+ K+-ATPase activity of 1+ parr, and in the whole-cell SDH activity of 0+ upper mode and 1+ parr, groups which subsequently underwent smoltification the following spring. The precise patterns differed between fish smolting at 1+ and 2+ years. Sexual maturation in 1+ parr inhibited their spring rises in Na+ K+-ATPase and SDH activities during smoltification at 2+ years. It is proposed that each class of juvenile salmon shows a distinct developmental pattern of ionoregulation, and that smoltification occurs at a particular ontogenic stage at which the fish are no longer suited to freshwater life, and so migrate seawards. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

abstract = {The mechanisms which control the formation and maintenance of pool-riffles are fundamental aspects of channel form and process. Most of the previous investigations on pool-riffle sequences have focused on alluvial rivers, and relatively few exist on the maintenance of these bedforms in boulder-bed channels. Here, we use a high-resolution two-dimensional flow model to investigate the interactions among large roughness elements, channel hydraulics, and the maintenance of a forced pool-riffle sequence in a boulder-bed stream. Model output indicates that at low discharge, a peak zone of shear stress and velocity occurs over the riffle. At or near bankfull discharge, the peak in velocity and shear stress is found at the pool head because of strong flow convergence created by large roughness elements. The strength of flow convergence is enhanced during model simulations of bankfull flow, resulting in a narrow, high velocity core that is translated through the pool head and pool center. The jet is strengthened by a backwater effect upstream of the constriction and the development of an eddy zone on the lee side of the boulder. The extent of flow convergence and divergence is quantified by identifying the effective width, defined here as the width which conveys 90{\%} of the highest modeled velocities. At low flow, the ratio of effective width between the pool and riffle is roughly 1:1, indicating little flow convergence or divergence. At bankfull discharge, the ratio of effective width is approximately 1:3 between the pool and downstream riffle, illustrating the strong flow convergence at the pool head. The effective width tends to equalize again with a ratio of 1:1 between the pool and riffle during a modeled discharge of a five-year flood, as the large roughness elements above the pool become drowned out. Results suggest that forced pool-riffle sequences in boulder-bed streams are maintained by flows at or near bankfull discharge because of stage-dependent variability in depth-averaged velocity and tractive force. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The paper forms the second part of an introduction to the SHE, a physically-based, distributed catchment modelling system produced jointly by the Danish Hydraulic Institute, the British Institute of Hydrology and SOGREAH (France) with the financial support of the Commission of the European Communities. The SHE is physically-based in the sense that the hydrological processes of water movement are modelled either by finite difference representations of the partial differential equations of mass, momentum and energy conservation, or by empirical equations derived from independent experimental research. Spatial distribution of catchment parameters, rainfall input and hydrological response is achieved in the horizontal by an orthogonal grid network and in the vertical by a column of horizontal layers at each grid square. Each of the primary processes of the land phase of the hydrological cycle is modelled in a separate component as follows: interception, by the Rutter accounting procedure; evapotranspiration, by the Penman- Monteith equation; overland and channel flow, by simplifications of the St. Venant equations; unsaturated zone flow, by the one-dimensional Richards equation; saturated zone flow, by the two-dimensional Boussinesq equation; snowmelt, by an energy budget method. Overall control of the parallel running of the components and the information exchanges between them is managed by a FRAME component. Careful attention has been devoted to a modular construction so that improvements or additional components (e.g. water quality and sediment yield) can be added in the future. Considerable operating flexibility is provided through the ability to vary the level of sophistication of the calculation mode to match the availability or quality of the data.},

However, intentional fragmentation may be beneficial when it prevents the spread ofnonnative species or exotic diseases, eliminates hybridization between hatchery and wild stocks, or stops individuals from becoming entrapped in sink environments. Strategies for fragmenting aquatic systems include maintaining existing natural barriers, taking advantage of existing anthropogenic features that impede movement, severing artificial con- nectivity created by human actions, and intentionally creating new barriers. Future challenges for managing fragmentation include maintaining hydrologie connectivity while blocking biological connectivity in water development projects; identifying approaches for maintaining incompatible taxa, such as sport fishes and small nongame species; and developing selective barriers that prevent the passage of unwanted species while allowing normal life-history movements of other species.},

Each stream has previously been described in terms of the dominant catchment land use, relative level of human disturbance and using a broad suite of water quality variables. Combination of ARISA with multivariate statistical analysis and ordination revealed that bacterial communities in streams located within rural catchments were significantly different to those within urban catchments. Broad-scale catchment land use described the largest component of the observed variation with no single water quality variable found to be a dominant determinant of the observed bacterial community variability, assessed using distance based redundancy analysis (dbRDA) of the ARISA data.

This unique damdecommissioning produced dramatic upstreamand downstreamgeomorphic responses in the hours and weeks following breaching.

Within 90min of breaching, the reservoir's water and {\~{}}10{\%} of its sediment had evacuated. At a gauging station 2.3 km downstream, flow increased briefly by 400m3 s?1 during passage of the initial pulse of released reservoir water, followed by a highly concentrated flow phase—up to 32{\%} sediment by volume—as landslide-generated slurries from the reservoir moved downstream. This hyperconcentrated flow, analogous to those following volcanic eruptions or large landslides, draped the downstream river with predominantly fine sand. During the ensuing weeks, suspended-sediment concentration declined and sand and gravel bed load derived from continued reservoir erosion aggraded the channel by{\textgreater}1mat the gauging station, after which the river incised back to near its initial elevation at this site. Within 15weeks after breaching, over 1millionm3 of suspended load is estimated to have passed the gauging station, consistent with estimates that{\textgreater}60{\%} of the reservoir's sediment had eroded. This dam removal highlights the influence of interactions among reservoir erosion processes, sediment composition, and style of decommissioning on rate of reservoir erosion and consequent downstream behavior of released sediment. 1.},

abstract = {The Sandusky River (Ohio, USA) is the subject of a controversial river restoration proposal involving the removal of a high-head dam to give walleye (Sander vitreus) access to upstream spawning areas. Habitat suitability index (HSI) models can add useful information for making such environmental decisions. In this work, a one-dimensional hydraulic river model is coupled with a collection of GIS routines programmed into the ArcGIS?? interface for calculating spatial distributions of depth, velocity, and spawning habitat suitability for walleye in a section of the river. The model is evaluated against in situ measurements of depth, velocity, and egg density. Results indicate that the model is accurate at predicting depths, but velocity predictions are generally lower than measured in the field. Despite this limitation, egg densities display a significant positive correlation with HSI (R2 = 0.19, P = 0.036), indicating that the model can give a general idea of spawning habitat suitability in the river. The model results indicate that the habitat suitability in the river, and hence reproductive success, is dependent on discharge. Habitat suitability is maximized at discharges of 20-25 m3/s. Flood events with discharges over 100 m3/s reduce the amount of highly suitable habitat in the river to less than 1{\%} of the total area. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Despite significant recent advancements, global hydrological models and their input databases still show limited capabilities in supporting many spatially detailed research questions and integrated assessments, such as required in freshwater ecology or applied water resources management. In order to address these challenges, the scientific community needs to create improved large-scale datasets and more flexible data structures that enable the integration of information across and within spatial scales; develop new and advanced models that support the assessment of longitudinal and lateral hydrological connectivity; and provide an accessible modeling environment for researchers, decision makers, and practitioners. As a contribution, we here present a new modeling framework that integrates hydrographic baseline data at a global scale (enhanced HydroSHEDS layers and coupled datasets) with new modeling tools, specifically a river network routing model (HydroROUT) that is currently under development. The resulting hydro-spatial fabric' is designed to provide an avenue for advanced hydro-ecological applications at large scales in a consistent and highly versatile way. Preliminary results from case studies to assess human impacts on water quality and the effects of dams on river fragmentation and downstream flow regulation illustrate the potential of this combined data-and-modeling framework to conduct novel research in the fields of aquatic ecology, biogeochemistry, geo-statistical modeling, or pollution and health risk assessments. The global scale outcomes are at a previously unachieved spatial resolution of 500 m and can thus support local planning and decision making in many of the world's large river basins.

abstract = {Currently, {\textgreater} 20 million acres in the United States are protected through conservation easements. While the role of property rights in enabling conservation easements is well documented, attitudes of landowners living under those property rights regimes have not been thoroughly researched. To address the knowledge gap, landowners in Texas with perpetual conservation easements participated in a mail survey and resulting data were compared with prior research on the property rights perspectives of a group of noneasement-owning rural landowners. Our study indicates that easement and noneasement landowners differ in their attitudes concerning both property rights and social responsibilities with respect to land management. While landowners in both groups agreed that property ownership conveyed certain fundamental rights, noneasement landowners expressed stronger conventional property rights attitudes than easement landowners. Counter to expectations, noneasement landowners were also more likely to express a stronger land stewardship ethic. We also found significant demographic differences between the two groups with easement landowners tending to be younger, having more formal education, being less likely to live on their rural property and owning their property for a shorter period of time. Those demographic differences, combined with differences between the two groups of landowners with respect to dependence on their land for income, locational differences of the two surveys from which data were obtained, and the 9-yr span between the two surveys limited our ability to extrapolate our findings to a broader population of landowners. Intragroup comparisons among easement landowners failed to find differences between easement-granting and successive generation easement landowners with respect to property rights orientations, but we did find some attitudinal differences between male and female respondents. Our research implies that landowners willing to accept substantial property rights adjustments designed to facilitate environmental protection goals may have inherently different attitudes concerning property rights ideals.},

In this paper, we use remotesensing techniques in a case study to explore the effects of multiple small stock-pond dams on tributaries to Chileno Creek, a coastal watershed in central California. Dam density, or number of dams per drainage area, is 0.76 dams per km{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, with most of the tributaries containing one or more dams. The total eroding channel length downstream of dams is {\~{}}11{\%} greater than total eroding length upstream. The relatively high density of the small stock-pond dams leads to cumulative effects that elevate the magnitude of (1) increased downstream erosion and (2) fragmentation of longitudinal connectivity between tributary headwaters and the main channel. The total headwater area producing sediment blocked by small dams equals 30{\%} of the Chileno watershed. From these data, we infer that reduced sediment load due to the presence of the dams slows downstream riparian recovery. Results of the Chileno Creek case study emphasize that basin-scale management approaches and restoration strategies to restore connectivity are imperative in watersheds with high dam density. Uncertainty related to the biophysical effects of small dams and their removal may be investigated through analysis of baseline and long-term monitoring data, and adaptive assessment and management. {\textcopyright} 2013 Geological Society of America.

abstract = {We outline a view of how road networks interact with stream networks at the landscape scale and, based on examples from recent and current research, illustrate how these interactions might affect biological and ecological processes in stream and riparian systems. At the landscape scale, certain definable geometric interactions involving peak flows (floods) and debris flows (rapid movements of soil, sediment, and large wood down steep stream channels) are influences by the arrangement of the road network relative to the stream network. Although disturbance patches are created by peak-flow and debris-flow disturbances in mountain landscapes without roads, roads can alter the landscape distributions of the starting and stopping points of debris flows, and they can alter the balance between the intensity of flood peaks and the stream network's resistance to change. We examined this conceptual model of interactions between road networks and stream networks based on observations from a number of studies in the H. J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregan (U.S.A.). Road networks appear to affect floods and debris flows and thus modify disturbance patch dynamics in stream and riparian networks in mountain landscapes. We speculate that these changes may influence the rates and patterns of survival and recovery of disturbed patches in stream networks, affecting ecosystem resilience, and we outline an approach for detecting such effects based on a patch dynamics perspective. A field sampling scheme for detecting the magnitude of various road effects on stream and riparian ecology could involve (1) landscape stratification of inherent stream network susceptibility to floods or debris flows, (2) overlay of road and stream networks and creation of areas with various densities of road-stream crossings, and (3) designations of expected high- and low-impact stream segments based on numbers of upstream road-stream crossings where sampling of selected biological variables would be conducted.},

We evaluated a sample of the academic literature to deter- mine whether links are made explicit between ecological restoration, society, and public policy related to natural capital. We analyzed 1,582 peer-reviewed papers dealing with ecological restoration published between 1 January 2000 and 30 September 2008 in 13 leading scientific jour- nals. As selection criterion, we considered papers that con- tained either “restoration” or “rehabilitation” in their title, abstract, or keywords. Furthermore, as one-third of the papers were published in Restoration Ecology,weusedthat journal as a reference for comparison with all the other journals. We readily acknowledge that aquatic ecosystems are under-represented, and that the largely inaccessible gray literature was ignored. Within these constraints, we found clear evidence that restoration practitioners are fail- ing to signal links between ecological restoration, society, and policy, and are underselling the evidence of benefits of restoration as a worthwhile investment for society. We discuss this assertion and illustrate it with samples of our findings—with regards to (1) the geographical and institu- tional affiliations of authors; (2) the choice of ecosystems studied, methods employed, monitoring schemes applied, and the spatial scale of studies; and (3) weak links to pay- ments for ecosystem service setups, agriculture, and rami- fications for public policy},

abstract = {When a humid region is affected by arid climate, significant changes in drought characteristics occur due to imbalance of water budget. In this study, change in drought characteristics according to shift of different climates i.e. tropical, warm temperate, cold and polar to Arid Climate (SAC) was analyzed over the Asia monsoon region. Climate zones and the SAC regions were identified by applying the K{\"{o}}ppen climate classification on hydro-meteorological data for the period of 1963-2006. The analysis of hydro-meteorological parameters revealed that the annual precipitation and runoff in the SAC regions appeared to decrease about 12.1{\%} and 27.3{\%}, respectively, while annual average temperature increased about 0.5. °C. Standardized runoff index (SRI) was calculated using model-driven runoff data. The trend and change point analyses of SRI were performed to evaluate the changes in drought characteristics (frequency, duration, severity) before and after shifting of the different climates to arid climate. The results revealed strong decreasing trend of SRI and hence intensified drought conditions for the SAC regions. A change point year of drought occurred about 3-5. years earlier than the shifting time of the SAC region. Frequency and duration of droughts in the SAC regions were observed to increase about 9.2 and 1.5. months, respectively, and drought severity index intensified to about -0.15. It can be concluded that analysis of shifting to arid climate zones should be considered together with changes in drought characteristics, because the drought characteristics and changing arid climate zones are closely related to each other.},

abstract = {Since the publication of the first edition (1994) there have been rapid developments in the application of hydrology, geomorphology and ecology to stream management. In particular, growth has occurred in the areas of stream rehabilitation and the evaluation of environmental flow needs. The concept of stream health has been adopted as a way of assessing stream resources and setting management goals. Stream Hydrology: An Introduction for Ecologists Second Edition documents recent research and practice in these areas. Chapters provide information on sampling, field techniques, stream analysis, the hydrodynamics of moving water, channel form, sediment transport and commonly used statistical methods such as flow duration and flood frequency analysis. Methods are presented from engineering hydrology, fluvial geomorphology and hydraulics with examples of their biological implications. This book demonstrates how these fields are linked and utilised in modern, scientific river management. Emphasis on applications, from collecting and analysing field measurements to using data and tools in stream management. Updated to include new sections on environmental flows, rehabilitation, measuring stream health and stream classification. Critical reviews of the successes and failures of implementation. Revised and updated windows-based AQUAPAK software. This book is essential reading for 2nd/3rd year undergraduates and postgraduates of hydrology, stream ecology and fisheries science in Departments of Physical Geography, Biology, Environmental Science, Landscape Ecology, Environmental Engineering and Limnology. It would be valuable reading for professionals working in stream ecology, fisheries science and habitat management, environmental consultants and engineers.},

abstract = {Multi-model comparison can provide useful information for model selection and improvement. In this study, twelve monthly water balance models with different structures and various degree of complexity are compared in 153 catchments with different climatic conditions in China. Generally, the GR5M model has the best performance, followed by the GR2M and WBM model. We investigate the relations between model performance and catchment characteristics and find that the climatic characteristic of a catchment is the most important factor impacting model performance. The models have better performance in wet catchments than in dry catchments. Large differences of model performance exist in dry catchments and model users should pay attention to model selection in dry catchments. In addition, we analyze the model performances among different models and conclude that increasing the model complexity does not guarantee a better model performance. Simple models can achieve comparable or even better performance than complex models. For the monthly simulation of hydrological processes, a two-parameter model is sufficient to achieve a good result. Moreover, by comparing the impacts of evapotranspiration simulation and runoff generation simulation on model performance, we find that evapotranspiration simulation has limited influence on the model performance. We suggest model builders focus on runoff generation process rather than evapotranspiration process to improve the performance of a monthly hydrological model.},

The 75,000 dams in the continental United States are capable of storing a volume of water almost equaling one year's mean runoff, but there is considerable geographic variation in potential surface water impacts. In some western mountain and plains regions, dams can store more than 3 year's runoff, while in the Northeast and Northwest, storage is as little as 25{\%} of the annual runoff. Dams partition watersheds; the drainage area per dam varies from 44 km2 (17 miles2) per dam in New England to 811 km2 (313 miles2) per dam in the Lower Colorado basin. Storage volumes, indicators of general hydrologic effects of dams, range from 26,200 m3 km{\&}{\#}8722;2 (55 acre-feet mile{\&}{\#}8722;2) in the Great Basin to 345,000 m3 km{\&}{\#}8722;2 (725 acre-feet mile{\&}{\#}8722;2) in the South Atlantic region. The greatest river flow impacts occur in the Great Plains, Rocky Mountains, and the arid Southwest, where storage is up to 3.8 times the mean annual runoff. The nation's dams store 5000 m3 (4 acre-feet) of water per person. Water resource regions have experienced individualized histories of cumulative increases in reservoir storage (and thus of downstream hydrologic and ecologic impacts), but the most rapid increases in storage occurred between the late 1950s and the late 1970s. Since 1980, increases in storage have been relatively minor.},

abstract = {The complex interplay of biological, physical, and chemical processes in pedogenesis and hillslope evolution limits our ability to predict and interpret landscape dynamics. Here, we synthesize a suite of observations from the steep, forested Oregon Coast Range to analyze the role of trees in topographic modification and bedrock-to-soil conversion. Using topographic data derived from airborne lidar, we demonstrate that the topographic signature of forest-driven soil and bedrock disturbance is pervasive. For length scales greater than 7.5. m, the land surface is defined by ridge-valley landforms, whereas smaller scales are dominated by pit-mound features generated by the turnover of large coniferous trees. From field surveys, the volume of bedrock incorporated in overturned rootwads increases rapidly with diameter for large conifers, reflecting the highly nonlinear increase in root biomass with tree diameter. Because trees younger than 60. years detach negligible bedrock, short timber harvest intervals may limit the extent to which root systems penetrate bedrock and facilitate bedrock fracturing and biogeochemical weathering. Using ground-penetrating radar, we show that the rootwads of large trees root achieve substantial penetration (1-3. m) into shallow bedrock. The radar transects also reveal that variations in soil thickness have characteristic length scales of 1 to 5. m, consistent with the scale of large rootwads, indicating that both the landscape surface and soil-bedrock interface exhibit a biogenic imprint. In our study area, the residence time of bedrock within dense rooting zones directly below large trees is similar to the time required for trees to occupy the entire forest floor through multiple cycles of forest succession, suggesting that biological modification of shallow bedrock is ubiquitous. Given increases in erosion rate, the ability of roots to initiate soil production may decline as bedrock exhumation through the biotic zone is rapid relative to the time required for successive forests and their associated root systems to fracture bedrock. As a result, in rapidly eroding terrain the coupling between biotic and abiotic weathering processes (such as exfoliation fracturing) may dictate the maximum rate of bedrock-to-soil conversion. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Geomorphologists have studied and debated over the processes responsible for natural riffle-pool maintenance for decades. Most studies have focused on small wadable rivers, but they lack much description of overbank flood conditions or a spatially explicit characterization of morphodynamics. In this study, 1-m horizontal resolution digital elevation models were collected from a riffle-pool-run sequence before and after an overbank flood with a 7.7-year recurrence interval on the relatively large gravel-bed lower Yuba River, California. Digital elevation model differencing was used to quantify the magnitude and pattern of flood-induced morphodynamic change. Cross section based analysis and two-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling of flows ranging from 0.147 to 7.63 times bankful discharge were completed to evaluate the hydraulic mechanisms responsible for the observed topographic changes. One key finding was that riffle-pool relief increased by 0.42??m, confirming the occurrence of natural hydrogeomorphic maintenance. Spatially complex patterns of scour and deposition exceeding 0.15??m at the scale of subwidth morphological units were reasonably predicted by the two-dimensional mechanistic model that accounts for convective acceleration. The one-dimensional cross section based method underperformed the two-dimensional model significantly. Consequently, multiple scales of channel non-uniformity and a dynamic flow regime caused the observed maintenance of the pool-riffle morphology through the mechanism of "flow convergence routing" proposed by MacWilliams et al.

This study presents integrated artificial neural networks (ANN) models for prediction of sediment rating curve parameters (rating curve coefficient $\alpha$ and rating curve exponent $\beta$) for ungauged basins. The ANN models integrate a comprehensive list of input parameters to improve the accuracy achieved; the input parameters used include: soil, land use, topographic, climatic, and hydrometric data sets. The ANN models were trained on the randomly selected 2/3 of the dataset of 94 gauged streams in Ontario, Canada and validated on the remaining 1/3. The developed models have high correlation coefficients of 0.92 and 0.86 for $\alpha$ and $\beta$, respectively. The ANN model for the rating coefficient $\alpha$ is directly proportional to rainfall erosivity factor, soil erodibility factor, and apportionment entropy disorder index, whereas it is inversely proportional to vegetation cover and mean annual snowfall. The ANN model for the rating exponent $\beta$ is directly proportional to mean annual precipitation, the apportionment entropy disorder index, main channel slope, standard deviation of daily discharge, and inversely proportional to the fraction of basin area covered by wetlands and swamps. Sediment rating curves are essential tools for the calculation of sediment load, concentration-duration curve (CDC), and concentration-duration-frequency (CDF) analysis for more accurate assessment of water quality for ungauged basins.},

Getting the right balance between measures assessing benefits and costs is often a challenge in complex evaluations. The current paper argues that present studies sometimes set system boundaries too narrowly so that they omit key factors associated with hydropower. In particular, the role that hydroelectric resources can play to stabilize the overall electrical grid, and thus to leverage investments in other intermittent renewables, is only rarely accounted for in sustainability assessments. Based on a broad literature review, the authors articulate two key recommendations for future assessments: first, that such assessments should reflect on policy issues as well as environmental challenges with respect to existing hydropower potential within the current framework; second, that system boundaries should be extended not only to allow broad hydrological, ecological and geological assessments, but also to reasonably estimate hydro's potential benefits to the functioning of the overall electrical grid.},

abstract = {We developed two-dimensional computational fluid hydraulics–habitat suitability index (CFD–HSI) models to identify and qualitatively assess potential zones of shallow water depth and high water velocity that may present passage challenges for five major anadromous fish species in a 2.63-km reach of the main stem Penobscot River, Maine, as a result of a dam removal downstream of the reach. Suitability parameters were based on distribution of fish lengths and body depths and transformed to cruising, maximum sustained and sprint swimming speeds. Zones of potential depth and velocity challenges were calculated based on the hydraulic models; ability of fish to pass a challenge zone was based on the percent of river channel that the contiguous zone spanned and its maximum along-current length. Three river flows (low: 99.1m3 sec-1; normal: 344.9m3 sec-1; and high:792.9m3 sec-1) were modelled to simulate existing hydraulic conditions and hydraulic conditions simulating removal of a dam at the downstream boundary of the reach. Potential depth challenge zones were nonexistent for all low-flow simulations of existing conditions for deeper-bodied fishes. Increasing flows for existing conditions and removal of the dam under all flow conditions increased the number and size of potential velocity challenge zones, with the effects of zones being more pronounced for smaller species. The two-dimensional CFD–HSI model has utility in demonstrating gross effects of flow and hydraulic alteration, but may not be as precise a predictive tool as a three-dimensional model. Passability of the potential challenge zones cannot be precisely quantified for two-dimensional or three-dimensional models due to untested assumptions and incomplete data on fish swimming performance and behaviours.

abstract = {The two-meter high St. Johns Dam in Seneca County, Ohio, in the Eastern Corn Belt Plains ecoregion was removed from the fifth-order Sandusky River in November 2003. The macroinvertebrate community was sampled prior to and following removal of the dam to determine the response of that community to free-flowing conditions in the 13-km reach of the former impoundment and to a potential increase in sedimentation downstream. Macroinvertebrates were collected at three sites in the impoundment in November 2003 and at those and four other sites in late summer 2004 using the standard quantitative and qualitative methods employed routinely by the Ohio EPA, and the data were converted to Invertebrate Community Index (ICI) scores. The proportions of macroinvertebrates sensitive to degraded stream conditions were low at the three sites in the impoundment prior to dam removal but were similar to the proportions at the other four sites afterward. Similarly at those sites, the proportion of macroinvertebrates highly tolerant of degraded conditions declined markedly. On the basis of ICI scores, the macroinvertebrate community within the impoundment before dam removal was rated “Fair” at all three sites and thereby failed to meet the Warmwater Habitat (WWH) criterion for macroinvertebrates established by Ohio EPA as the goal for the Sandusky River. Ohio EPA had rated one of those sites as “Poor” in 2001. In summer 2004, nine months after dam removal, that site was rated “Fair”. Two sites immediately upstream of the former dam were rated “Good” (west side) and “Exceptional” (east side), and a fourth site in the former impoundment near its most upstream extent was rated “Good”. Thus, three of the four sites in the former impoundment met the WWH criterion. A site below the former dam and two sites upstream of the impoundment were rated “Good”. The combined results indicate that the biological quality of the Sandusky River in the formerly impounded reach improved rapidly in response to changes in habitat following removal of the dam.},

abstract = {Maintaining or restoring connectivity in aquatic systems can enhance migratory fish populations; maintain genetic diversity in small, isolated populations; allow organisms to access complementary habitats to meet life-history needs; and facilitate recolonization after local extirpations. However, intentional fragmentation may be beneficial when it prevents the spread ofnonnative species or exotic diseases, eliminates hybridization between hatchery and wild stocks, or stops individuals from becoming entrapped in sink environments. Strategies for fragmenting aquatic systems include maintaining existing natural barriers, taking advantage of existing anthropogenic features that impede movement, severing artificial con- nectivity created by human actions, and intentionally creating new barriers. Future challenges for managing fragmentation include maintaining hydrologie connectivity while blocking biological connectivity in water development projects; identifying approaches for maintaining incompatible taxa, such as sport fishes and small nongame species; and developing selective barriers that prevent the passage of unwanted species while allowing normal life-history movements of other species.},

abstract = {Despite extensive management and research, populations of American Shad Alosa sapidissima have experienced prolonged declines, and uncertainty about the underlying mechanisms causing these declines remains. In the springs of 2007 through 2010, we used a resistance board weir and PIT technology to capture, tag, and track American Shad in the Little River, North Carolina, a tributary to the Neuse River with complete and partial removals of lowhead dams. Our objectives were to examine migratory behaviors and estimate weight loss, survival, and abundance during each spawning season. Males typically immigrated earlier than females and also used upstream habitat at a higher percentage, but otherwise exhibited relatively similar migratory patterns. Proportional weight loss displayed a strong positive relationship with both cumulative water temperature during residence time and number of days spent upstream, and to a lesser extent, minimum distance the fish traveled in the river. Surviving emigrating males lost up to 30{\%} of their initial weight and females lost up to 50{\%} of their initial weight, indicating there are potential survival thresholds. Survival for the spawning season was low and estimates ranged from 0.07 to 0.17; no distinct factors (e.g., sex, size, migration distance) that could contribute to survival were detected. Sampled and estimated American Shad abundance increased from 2007 through 2009, but was lower in 2010. Our study provides substantial new information about American Shad spawning that may aid restoration efforts.},

abstract = {The Murray-Darling Basin is Australia's food bowl and home to many iconic water bodies that are culturally and ecologically highly valued. The recent Millennium Drought (from mid-1990s to 2009) was the most severe hydrological drought since records started in the late 19th century. It severely impacted on the basin and for many acted as a wake-up call. To address the ongoing declines in water resources and environmental conditions and to prepare the region for climate change, Australia's Governments are currently attempting to introduce a new comprehensive, and integrated approach to the management of the basin's water resources. In this paper, long-term time series of climate, hydrological and environmental data are used to analyze how compounding stresses have gradually affected the hydrological system and its services. Major hydroclimatic stresses considered in this paper include salinity, water use, droughts, and climate change. Other, more localized or minor stresses exist (groundwater extraction, farm dams, afforestation, bush fires, cyanobacterial blooms and pollutants) and are reviewed more briefly. The history of water policy and planning shows that Government actions have been strongly influential on the basin. A shift in the strategic goals from water development to the protection and restoration of environmental assets is noticeable since the mid 1990s. Median climate change projections by 2030 indicate smaller reductions in rainfall and runoff than those observed during the recent Millennium Drought, but have a relatively high uncertainty attached to them. The use of regional approaches to reduce that uncertainty, such as statistical downscaling, points to a sizeable decline in rainfall by the end of the century. Most climate projections used for planning consider greenhouse emission scenarios that have smaller global emission trends than the one observed over the last decade. Other, 'less optimistic' scenarios have to be considered for long-term water planning and food security. Compounding all these stresses, is the naturally high hydroclimatic variability of this semi-arid region, that may have been insufficiently considered during previous water development and planning efforts. Successful water planning will need to balance cultural and ecological values with food production, account for high natural variability and uncertainty in climate change projections, learn from past mistakes and be cognizant of future hydrological changes. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

Focusing on the macroinvertebrate community dynamics and its relationship with hydrological factors ten years after impoundment, we provide an overview of the macroinvertebrate community succession in the TGR including determining factors. Pioneer species in the TGR was Polypedilum scalaenum while Nais inflata became dominant during non-flooding seasons commencing the second impounding year with extremely high relative abundance (up to 97{\%}). An increase of water-level fluctuation range in the third impoundment stage did not significantly alter the steady seasonal pattern of macroinvertebrate community which formed following the second impounding year. MRPP (Multi-response Permutation Procedure) analysis showed significant differences between-season (A{\textless}0.3, P {\textless} 0.01) except between summer and autumn (A = -0.0165, P = 0.773). Macroinvertebrate assemblages were evidently correlated with inflow discharge during flood seasons and water retention time during non-flood seasons. Macroinvertebrate density showed severe reduction in summer following high velocity inflow current, and disappeared in autumn following vast sedimentation. The macroinvertebrate community gradually became reestablished following reduction of inflow discharge and sedimentation and increase of water retention time in winter and spring. Our analyses suggest that macroinvertebrate community in the TGR is regulated by the subtropical monsoon climate, commencing with seasonal cycles of destruction followed by reestablishment.},

abstract = {Dam removal is an increasingly common practice. Dams are removed for various reasons, with safety, economics, and ecosystem restoration being the most common. However, dam removals often cause controversy. Riparian land owners and local communities often have a negative view of removal, and their reasons vary. It may be the loss of recreational benefits such as swimming and boating, loss of cultural and historical context tied to the dam, or fear that removal may have a negative effect on aesthetic values. Because controversies are often picked up by local media, and media in itself is an important channel to build support around a cause, the way in which dam removals are reported and discussed in the media is likely to influence the debate. Here, we examine the ways in which proponents and opponents of dam removal frame the services provided by two contrasting ecosystems, i.e., an existing dam and the potential stream without a dam, by performing a media discourse analysis of the reasons given for removal and the reasons presented for the dam to remain in place. Our source material includes Internet- based newspaper articles and their associated public comments in four dam removal controversies in Sweden. Our analysis indicates that public opposition is not based on knowledge deficiency, where more information will lead to better ecological decision-making, as is sometimes argued in dam removal science; it is instead a case of different understandings and valuation of the environment and the functions it provides.},

In 2011, the share of renewable sources in electricity production reached 88.8{\%}, mainly due to the large national water potential. Although the Brazilian energy model presents a strong potential for expansion, the total energy that could be used with most current renewable technologies often outweighs the national demand. The current composition of the national energy matrix has outstanding participation of hydropower, even though the country has great potential for the exploitation of other renewable energy sources such as wind, solar and biomass. This document therefore refers to the trend of evolution of the Brazilian Energy Matrix and exposes possible mitigation scenarios, also considering climate change. The methodology to be used in the modeling includes the implementation of the LEAP System (Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning) program, developed by the Stockholm Environment Institute, which allows us to propose different scenarios under the definition of socioeconomic scenarios and base power developed in the context of the REGSA project (Promoting Renewable Electricity Generation in South America).

In response to this need, major new initiatives in hydropower development are now under way. At least 3,700 major dams, each with a capacity of more than 1 MW, are either planned or under construction, primarily in countries with emerging economies. These dams are predicted to increase the present global hydroelectricity capacity by 73 {\%} to about 1,700 GW. Even such a dramatic expansion in hydropower capacity will be insufficient to compensate for the increasing electricity demand. Furthermore, it will only partially close the electricity gap, may not substantially reduce greenhouse gas emission (carbon dioxide and methane), and may not erase interdependencies and social conflicts. At the same time, it is certain to reduce the number of our planet's remaining free-flowing large rivers by about 21 {\%}. Clearly, there is an urgent need to evaluate and to mitigate the social, economic, and ecological ramifications of the current boom in global dam construction.},

abstract = {Dam removals with unmanaged sediment releases are good opportunities to learn about channel response to abruptly increased bed material supply. Understanding these events is important because they affect aquatic habitats and human uses of floodplains. A longstanding paradigm in geomorphology holds that response rates to landscape disturbance exponentially decay through time. However, a previous study of the Merrimack Village Dam (MVD) removal on the Souhegan River in New Hampshire, USA, showed that an exponential function poorly described the early geomorphic response. Erosion of impounded sediments there was two-phased. We had an opportunity to quantitatively test the two-phase response model proposed for MVD by extending the record there and comparing it with data from the Simkins Dam removal on the Patapsco River in Maryland, USA. The watershed sizes are the same order of magnitude (102km2), and at both sites low-head dams were removed ({\~{}}3–4m) and {\~{}}65 000m3 of sand-sized sediments were discharged to low-gradient reaches. Analyzing four years of repeat morphometry and sediment surveys at the Simkins site, as well as continuous discharge and turbidity data, we observed the two-phase erosion response described for MVD. In the early phase, approximately 50{\%} of the impounded sediment at Simkins was eroded rapidly during modest flows. After incision to base level and widening, a second phase began when further erosion depended on floods large enough to go over bank and access impounded sediments more distant from the newly-formed channel. Fitting functional forms to the data for both sites, we found that two-phase exponential models with changing decay constants fit the erosion data better than single-phase models. Valley width influences the two-phase erosion responses upstream, but downstream responses appear more closely related to local gradient, sediment re-supply from the upstream impoundments, and base flows.

abstract = {Recent efforts of the US Department of Energy's (DOE) Hydropower Program have focused on the mitigation of adverse effects of dams on upstream and downstream fish passage. An initial study of 707 recently licensed hydropower projects in the United States indicated that approximately 11{\%} were required to provide upstream fish passage and 28{\%} were required to provide downstream fish passage. Despite considerable effort to design and install fish passage devices, many projects had no detailed performance criteria and no performance monitoring requirements. A follow-up study examined the effectiveness of fish passage mitigative measures at 16 hydropower projects that had conducted performance monitoring. Fish ladders and lifts can be very effective in moving fish upstream past a dam; some of the case study projects were nearly 100{\%} effective. Three of the 12 case studies with downstream passage measures have successfully increased the survival of downstream-migrating fish. However, in other instances the devices have failed or, more commonly, operational monitoring has not been adequate to make a judgement about their effectiveness. As an alternative to downstream fish passage screening, the DOE Advanced Hydropower Turbine Systems Program has begun a phased effort to design, build and test fish-friendly turbines, i.e. turbine systems in which environmental attributes such as entrainment survival, instream flow needs, and/or water quality enhancement are emphasised. Such turbine systems could allow the efficient generation of electricity while minimising the damage to fish and their habitats.},

abstract = {The effects of large floods on river morphology are variable and poorly understood. In this study, we apply multi-temporal datasets collected with small unmanned aircraft systems (UASs) to analyze three-dimensional morphodynamic changes associated with an extreme flood event that occurred from 19 to 23 June 2013 on the Elbow River, Alberta. We documented reach-scale spatial patterns of erosion and deposition using high-resolution (4-5 cm/pixel) orthoimagery and digital elevation models (DEMs) produced from photogrammetry. Significant bank erosion and channel widening occurred, with an average elevation change of -0.24 m. The channel pattern was reorganized and overall elevation variation increased as the channel adjusted to full mobilization of most of the bed surface sediments. To test the extent to which geomorphic changes can be predicted from initial conditions, we compared shear stresses from a two-dimensional hydrodynamic model of peak discharge to critical shear stresses for bed surface sediment sizes. We found no relation between modeled normalized shear stresses and patterns of scour and fill, confirming the complex nature of sediment mobilization and flux in high-magnitude events. However, comparing modeled peak flows through the pre- and post-flood topography showed that the flood resulted in an adjustment that contributes to overall stability, with lower percentages of bed area below thresholds for full mobility in the post-flood geomorphic configuration. Overall, this work highlights the potential of UAS-based remote sensing for measuring three-dimensional changes in fluvial settings and provides a detailed analysis of potential relationships between flood forces and geomorphic change.},

When one considers torrential mountainbrooks, large rivers of lowlands, and greatrivers whose basins occupy subcontinents, it isapparent how location-specific environmentalfactors contribute to the sense of uniquenessand diversity of running waters. At the sametime, however, our improved understanding ofecological, biogeochemical, hydrological, andgeomorphological processes provides insightinto the structural and functional characteristicsof river systems that brings a unifying frameworkto this field of study. Inputs and transformationsof energy and materials are important in all riversystems, regional species richness and local speciesinteractions influence the structure of allriverine communities, and the interaction of physicaland biological forces is important to virtuallyevery question that has been asked. It seemsthat the processes acting in running waters aregeneral, but the settings are often unique.We believe that it helps the reader, when somepattern or result is described, to have someimage of what kind of stream or river is underinvestigation, and also where it is located.Stream ecology, like all ecology, depends greatlyon context: place, environmental conditions,season, and species. This text includes frequentuse of descriptors like ``small woodland stream,''``open pastureland stream,'' or ``large lowlandriver,'' and we believe that readers will findthese useful clues to the patterns and processesthat are reported. For most studies within theUnited States we have included further regionaldescription, but have done so less frequently forstudies from elsewhere around the globe. Weapologize to our international readers for thispragmatic choice, and we have made everyeffort to include examples and literature fromoutside of North America.Some locations have established themselves asleading centers of study due to the work of manyresearchers carried out over decades. The HubbardBrook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire,Coweeta Hydrologic Laboratory in NorthCarolina, and some individual streams includingWalker Branch in Tennessee, Sycamore Creek inArizona, R o las Mar as in Venezuela, and theTaeri and Whatawhata in New Zealand are locationsthat appear frequently in the pages thatfollow. Knowing what these places are like, andhow they may or may not be typical, in our viewjustifies the frequent use of place names andbrief descriptions. The names of organisms alsoappear frequently and may at first overwhelmthe reader. It may be easiest to pay them littleattention until they gradually become familiar.Ultimately, it is difficult to really comprehendthe outcome of a study without some appreciationfor the organisms that were present.xiiiAs is true for every area of ecology at present,the study of streams and rivers cannot beaddressed exclusive of the role of human activities,nor can we ignore the urgency of the needfor conservation. This is a two-way street. Ecologistswho study streams without consideringhow past or present human modifications ofthe stream or its valley might have contributedto their observations do so at the risk of incompleteunderstanding. Conservation efforts thatlack an adequate scientific basis are less likelyto succeed. One trend that seems safe to forecastin stream ecology is toward a greater emphasison understanding human impacts. Fortunately,signs of this trend are already apparent.We have organized the flow of topics in a waythat is most logical to us, but no doubt somereaders will prefer to cover topics in whateverorder they find most useful. For this reason, wehave striven to explain enough in each chapter sothat it is comprehensible on its own.

abstract = {Although studies of sediment transport in steep and coarse-grained channels have been more numerous in recent years, the dynamics of sediment transport in step-pool river systems remain poorly understood. This paper investigates displacements of individual clasts through Spruce Creek (Qu{\'{e}}bec, Canada), a classic step-pool channel, and the effects of the channel morphology on the path length of the clasts. Passive integrated transponder tags (PIT) were used to track the displacement of 196 individual particles over a range of discharges including the bankfull stage. Clasts were tracked after five sequences of flood events. The results showed that the distance distributions match a two-parameter Gamma model. Equal mobility transport occurs for the particle size investigated during each sequence of flood events. Mean travel distance of the clasts can be estimated from excess stream power, and the mobility of the clasts is more than an order of magnitude less than the model reported in riffle-pool channels. The dominant morphological length scale of the bed also controls the path length of the clasts. These results confirm some preliminary observations on sediment transport in step-pool channels. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The study is aimed at investigating the response of the riffle–pool sequence to increased energy expenditure in the horizontal plane through meander development. It emphasizes field measurements of riffle–pool height and spacing and their links with meander morphology. River reaches in southern Ontario (Canada) were surveyed and statistical relations were established between parameters describing riffle–pool morphology (sequence length and amplitude) and planform curvature. The results indicate a lengthening of the sequence with increased total angular deflection along the measured reaches. Further analysis suggests that this lengthening occurs in the pool as a result of meander development. Apparently, as the path length extends beyond a critical threshold for a given bed material size, the transport capacity of the sequence is compromised. This may promote an initial shortening of the downstream riffle, with depositional processes ultimately forming a new riffle slightly upstream to achieve a new equilibrium. Additional extensive data sets provided by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority on riffle–pool morphology also suggest that bed material size plays a significant role in controlling riffle–pool morphology.},

abstract = {Enormous cost and manpower utilization encountered in constructing a water resource project demands a great deal of attention in devising precise Rainfall-Runoff models for its successful performance. These models are dependent on the physiographic, climatic and biotic characteristics of the basin. These factors sometimes induce either a linear, non-linear or highly complex behaviour among the rainfall and runoff parameters. The unstructured nature of Rainfall-Runoff relations has diverted the attention of researchers towards Soft Computing tools which, harnesses reasoning, intuition, consciousness and wisdom possessed by human beings. Soft Computing being a multi-disciplinary field uses a variety of statistical, probabilistic and optimization tools which complement each other to produce its three main branches viz., Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms and Fuzzy Logic. These techniques, whether complementing each other or working on their own, are able to model complex or unknown relationships which are either nonlinear or noisy. The review paper presents an introduction to these techniques and discusses their applications in modelling Rainfall-Runoff relations which to some extent have replaced time consuming conventional mathematical techniques with wiser and time saving computing tools.},

abstract = {A combination of driving forces are increasing pressure on local, national, and regional water supplies needed for irrigation, energy production, industrial uses, domestic purposes, and the environment. In many parts of Europe groundwater quantity, and in particular quality, have come under sever degradation and water levels have decreased resulting in negative environmental impacts. Rapid improvements in the economy of the eastern European block of countries and uncertainties with regard to freshwater availability create challenges for water managers. At the same time, climate change adds a new level of uncertainty with regard to freshwater supplies. In this research we build and calibrate an integrated hydrological model of Europe using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) program. Different components of water resources are simulated and crop yield and water quality are considered at the Hydrological Response Unit (HRU) level. The water resources are quantified at subbasin level with monthly time intervals. Leaching of nitrate into groundwater is also simulated at a finer spatial level (HRU). The use of large-scale, high-resolution water resources models enables consistent and comprehensive examination of integrated system behavior through physically-based, data-driven simulation. In this article we discuss issues with data availability, calibration of large-scale distributed models, and outline procedures for model calibration and uncertainty analysis. The calibrated model and results provide information support to the European Water Framework Directive and lay the basis for further assessment of the impact of climate change on water availability and quality. The approach and methods developed are general and can be applied to any large region around the world.},

abstract = {1. Two of the most common consequences resulting from land use and climate change are increased fine sediment loads and shifts in hydrological regimes in freshwater ecosystems. 2. Although a growing number of studies indicate that these stressors are likely to directly affect community composition and organism physiology, little is known about how biological structures produced by aquatic organisms might respond. For example, hydropsychid caddisflies (Trichoptera) are a group of globally distributed aquatic insects that spin silk mesh nets that they use to filter feed. These silk mesh nets are important ecosystem engineering structures in flowing waters that can regulate sediment erosion, food particle delivery by altering near-bed current velocities, and enhance habitat availability for other macroinvertebrates. 3. We conducted two experiments in laboratory mesocosms to assess the effects of increased fine sediment and drought on hydropsychid caddisfly silk. We compared silk thread diameter, thread count, mesh pore area, and thread tensile strength across treatments in which the silk nets were exposed to high levels of total suspended solids or to stream drying over 2 weeks. 4. We found that caddisfly silk was resilient to both forms of stress and maintained its overall structure and tensile strength. 5. Our findings indicate that biological silk structures may be viable ecosystem engineering tools following short-lived disturbances associated with increased sediment loads and drying events. Caddisfly silk may be resilient to various forms of environmental change, with important consequences for recovery of aquatic communities.},

abstract = {1. Protected area networks for river ecosystems must account for the highly connected nature of river habitats and the fact that conditions in distant locations can influence downstream habitats and biota. We used Marxan conservation planning software to address the unique constraints of reserve design in river ecosystems and structure a reserve network to overcome key challenges to freshwater conservation. 2. The range limits of 63 fish species in Mesoamerica were predicted and used in Marxan to design a network of conservation focal areas that encompasses 15{\%} of the range of each species in areas with low risk of environmental degradation. Upstream risk intensity was estimated by propagating landscape-based sources of stress downstream along the direction of flow in GIS. We constrained Marxan solutions to account for basin divides, and we defined critical management zones to include important habitats that contribute to species persistence and mitigate threats. 3. The proposed reserve network encompassed 11{\%} of the study area, half of which was contained within existing protected areas. Our exercise also identified important gaps in protection. Because terrestrial-based environmental risks were propagated through the river network and considered in the solution, focal areas were constrained to catchments with low levels of upstream human activity. Addition of critical management zones – riparian buffers and fish migration corridors – expanded the network area by one-fifth. 4. Our application of Marxan allowed longitudinal connectivity and topographic barriers to species movement to be considered. Adding critical management zones expanded the size of the reserve network, but is crucial to the network's conservation efficacy. We call for an evaluation of the added management capacity needed to conserve critical management zones and suggest ways to further improve the reserve design process.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic manipulation of aquatic habitats can profoundly alter mercury (Hg) cycling and bioaccumulation. The impoundment of fluvial systems is among the most common habitat manipulations and is known to increase fish Hg concentrations immediately following impoundment. However, it is not well understood how Hg concentrations differ between reservoirs and lakes at large spatial and temporal scales or how reservoir management influences fish Hg concentrations. This study evaluated total Hg (THg) concentrations in 64,386 fish from 883 reservoirs and 1387 lakes, across the western United States and Canada, to assess differences between reservoirs and lakes, as well as the influence of reservoir management on fish THg concentrations. Fish THg concentrations were 1.4-fold higher in reservoirs (0.13??????0.011????g/g wet weight??????standard error) than lakes (0.09??????0.006), though this difference varied among ecoregions. Fish THg concentrations were 1.5- to 2.6-fold higher in reservoirs than lakes of the North American Deserts, Northern Forests, and Mediterranean California ecoregions, but did not differ between reservoirs and lakes in four other ecoregions. Fish THg concentrations peaked in three-year-old reservoirs then rapidly declined in 4???12??year old reservoirs. Water management was particularly important in influencing fish THg concentrations, which were up to 11-times higher in reservoirs with minimum water storage occurring in May, June, or July compared to reservoirs with minimum storage occurring in other months. Between-year changes in maximum water storage strongly influenced fish THg concentrations, but within-year fluctuations in water levels did not influence fish THg concentrations. Specifically, fish THg concentrations increased up to 3.2-fold over the range of between-year changes in maximum water storage in all ecoregions except Mediterranean California. These data highlight the role of reservoir creation and management in influencing fish THg concentrations and suggest that water management may provide an effective means of mitigating Hg bioaccumulation in some reservoirs.},

abstract = {Boreal Baltic coastal wetlands differ markedly from temperate salt marshes by their generally low maximum elevation (between 0 and 1m above m.s.l.), low seaward gradients and the irregular nature of flooding that is characteristic of the NE Baltic Sea coastal region. As a result of these factors these wetlands have been considered to be threatened by future sea level rise. This study presents results for two Boreal Baltic coastal wetland sites in Estonia using the 210Pb and 137Cs radiometric dating methods to investigate the sedimentary development of these coastal systems. Recent coastal evolution has been largely driven by continuing glacio-isostatic adjustment (GIA), with maximum rates of 2.8mmyr−1 around the NW Estonian coast and the inherited geomorphological setting of generally flat-lying coastal topography, resulting in coastal emergence. Broad agreement exists between calculated rates of sedimentation identified within the core sequences. Average rates of sedimentation using the 210Pbexcess CF:CS (or ‘simple') model range between 0.2 and 1.3mmyr−1. These rates are corroborated using 137Cs, which also suggests an increase in sedimentation rates during recent decades approaching maximum values for current land uplift. Additionally, the 210Pbexcess CRS model reveals periods of sedimentation greatly in excess of these values in response to coastal flooding from known storm activity. This study indicates that changes in sea level caused by variations in atmospheric pressure and storm surges can contribute a significant sedimentary component, which coupled with GIA processes has driven coastal wetland development/emergence and the historical progradation of these wetland systems. The recent acceleration in the rate of global sea-level rise may subtly alter this relationship. However current rates of GIA and sedimentation will continue to maintain the progradation of Boreal Baltic coastal wetlands in the coming decades.},

abstract = {One-way connectivity maintained by fish passing through hydropower turbines in fragmented rivers can be important to population dynamics, but can also introduce a new and significant source of mortal-ity. Sources of mortality during turbine passage can come from several sources including blade strike, shear forces, cavitation, or pressure decreases and parsing the contributions of these individual forces is important for advancing and deploying turbines that minimize these impacts to fishes. We used a national hydropower database and conducted a systematic review of the literature to accomplish three goals: (1) report on the spatial distribution of turbine types and generation capacities in the USA, (2) determine fish mortality rates among turbine types and fish species and (3) examine relationships between physical forces similar to those encountered during fish turbine passage and fish injury and mortality. We found that while Francis turbines generate 56 {\%} of all US hydropower and have the highest associated fish mortality of any turbine type, these turbines are proportionally understudied compared to less-common and less injury-associated Kaplan turbines, particularly in the Pacific Northwest. While juvenile salmonid species in actual or simulated Kaplan turbine conditions were the most commonly studied, the highest mortality rates were reported from percid fishes passing through Francis turbines. Future studies should focus on understanding which species are most at-risk to turbine passage injury and mortality and, subsequently, increasing the diversity of taxon-omy and turbine types in evaluations of turbine injury and mortality.},

abstract = {Wavelet analysis is a powerful tool with which to analyse the hydrologic effects of dam construction and operation on river systems. Using continuous records of instantaneous discharge from the Lees Ferry gauging station and records of daily mean discharge from upstream tributaries, we conducted wavelet analyses of the hydrologic structure of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon. The wavelet power spectrum (WPS) of daily mean discharge provided a highly compressed and integrative picture of the post-dam elimination of pronounced annual and sub-annual flow features. The WPS of the continuous record showed the influence of diurnal and weekly power generation cycles, shifts in discharge management, and the 1996 experimental flood in the post-dam period. Normalization of the WPS by local wavelet spectra revealed the fine structure of modulation in discharge scale and amplitude and provides an extremely efficient tool with which to assess the relationships among hydrologic cycles and ecological and geomorphic systems. We extended our analysis to sections of the Snake River and showed how wavelet analysis can be used as a data mining technique. The wavelet approach is an especially promising tool with which to assess dam operation in less well-studied regions and to evaluate management attempts to reconstruct desired flow characteristics.

abstract = {Annual CO 2 emissions from lakes and other inland waters into the atmosphere are estimated to almost entirely com-pensate the total annual carbon uptake by oceans 1–3 . CO 2 supersaturation in lakes, which results in CO 2 emissions, is frequently attributed to CO 2 produced within the lake 4–8 . However, lateral inorganic carbon flux through watersheds can also be sizeable 9–11 . Here we calculated lake surface water CO 2 concentrations and emissions using lake pH, alkalinity and temperature from a compilation of data from 5,118 boreal lakes 12 . Autumn surface water CO 2 concentrations and CO 2 emissions from the 5,118 lakes co-varied with lake internal autumn CO 2 production. However, using a mass balance approach we found that CO 2 emission in the majority of lakes was sustained by inorganic carbon loading from the catchment rather than by internal CO 2 production. Small lakes with high dissolved organic carbon and phosphorus concentrations, shorter retention times and longer ice-free seasons had the highest CO 2 concentrations. CO 2 emissions from these small lakes was twice that of comparable lakes in colder regions, and similar to emissions from subtropical and tropical lakes. We conclude that changes in land use and climate that increase dissolved inorganic carbon may cause emission levels from boreal lakes to approach those of lakes in warmer regions. Recent studies have shown that inland waters emit substantial amounts of carbon dioxide (CO 2) into the atmosphere 1,2,13–15 . However, it is still uncertain to what extent the CO 2 is produced in terrestrial or in aquatic ecosystems. To answer this question, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) mass balances are needed. Mass balances have been applied to single lake ecosystems, showing that the dominant net CO 2 source in a lake can either be lake internal CO 2 production (for example, refs 16,17) or DIC inflow from lake external sources (for example, refs 10,18–21). Thus, dominance of both internal and lake external CO 2 production has been reported but it is still unknown how widespread a dominance of lake internal or lake external CO 2 production is. To fill this knowledge gap we applied DIC mass balances to 5,118 lakes in the boreal region using freely available freshwater data. The mass balances refer to autumn water chemical conditions before ice-on (see Methods), where DIC concentrations in dimictic lakes often peak for the second time of the year and CO 2 emissions from lakes are high 22 . For the mass balances we estimated lake internal CO 2 production, DIC inputs from lake external sources, DIC outflows and CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere. The internal CO 2 production (CO 2{\_}internal{\_}prod) comprised three processes: CO 2 production at the sediment–water interface by microbial mineralization (CO 2{\_}sediment{\_}prod ; equation (3)), CO 2 production in the water column by microbial mineralization of dissolved organic carbon (CO 2{\_}water{\_}prod ; equation (4)), and CO 2 production in the water column by photochemical mineralization (CO 2{\_}photo{\_}prod ; equation (5)). Among the three lake internal processes we found that CO 2{\_}water{\_}prod was generally the largest contributor to lake internal CO 2 production in the 5,118 boreal lakes, which had a median dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration of 11 g m −3 . CO 2{\_}water{\_}prod in the lakes ranged between 1 and 772 mg C m −2 d −1},

Therefore, our objective was to create a comprehensive database of mitigation required at non-federal hydropower projects and provide a synthesis of available mitigation data. Mitigation data was collated for over 300 plants licensed or relicensed from 1998 through 2013. We observed that the majority of FERC mitigation requirements deal with either hydrologic flows or recreation and that hydropower plants in the Pacific Northwest had the highest number of requirements. Our data indicate opportunities exist to further explore hydropower mitigation in the areas of environmental flows, fish passage, and water quality. Connecting these data with ecological outcomes, actual flow data, and larger landscape level information will be necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation and ultimately inform regulators, managers, and planners.},

abstract = {Marine features associated with Late Quaternary isostatic adjustment are well documented in central and coastalMaine, United States. However, the effects of glacially induced land-surface tilting in the interior of the state and its affects on coastal landforms are not well understood. Investigations at Moosehead Lake, Maine's largest lake, indicates that isostatically forced tilting shifted the lake's outlet from the Penobscot River drainage to the Kennebec River drainage, resulting in a significant effect on marine delta formation through changes in the discharge and competence of the Kennebec and Penobscot Rivers, two of the largest in the region. Historic stream-gage data are used as an analogue to quantify the effect of the outlet shift on the relative discharge of these two rivers. These data suggest that, in the upper portions of the watersheds, the Penobscot River lost approximately 25{\%} of its annual discharge, while the Kennebec River experienced an approximately 74{\%} increase in annual discharge. The timing of this change, established in the abandoned lake outlet into the Penobscot River, coincides with the end of deposition of the Penobscot paleodelta in Penobscot Bay and the onset of deposition of the western lobe of the Kennebec paleodelta. This indicates that changing river discharges were also linked to changes in sediment loads at the rivers' mouths. In addition, these findings imply that coarse-grained fluvial deposits (North Anson Formation) identified in the upper Kennebec valley may be the result of the rapid and large increase in river discharge associatedwith the divide shift. Recognition of both marine and fluvial features associatedwith isostatic adjustment emphasizes the importance of this process on early postglacial landscape formation.},

abstract = {System coupling and landscape connectivity control the flow of water and sediment through landscapes. Although coupling is well known to control long-term landscape development and shorter-term sensitivity to disturbance, the anthropogenic influences on coupling are seldom considered in hydrologic investigations. In particular, the building of small-scale water diversion (earth banks) and collection (farm dams) infrastructure on hillslopes in dryland agricultural areas may significantly alter hillslope-channel coupling. Twelve sub-catchment basins in a dryland agricultural region were investigated under their natural (ignoring infrastructure) and modified (including infrastructure) conditions to investigate the influence of water collection infrastructure on hydrologic connectivity, and whether manual modification of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) could account for the impact of these factors in hydrologic simulation of hydrologic and geomorphic processes. Dam numbers and density have both increased over the period of available aerial photography (1965-1999), resulting in an average 39.5{\%} reduction (range 4.3-86.7{\%}) in the area retaining hydrologic connectivity with the basin outlet. Analysis of basins dominated by either banks or dams, and with combinations of both was performed using the Cumulative Area Distribution (CAD), Hypsometric Curve (HC), Simplified Width Function (SWF) and Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH). The geomorphic descriptors (CAD and HC) showed little change in basin structure as a result of farm dam and bank construction, but hydrologic descriptors (SWF and IUH) indicate that hillslope processes are significantly altered by farm dams and banks. Because runoff models are sensitive to catchment area, incorporating hillslope water capture and diversion infrastructure into the base data sets may offer a solution to improved parameterisation of spatial models of hydrology, particularly in dryland agricultural regions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Two dams on the Elwha River, Washington State, USA trapped over 20millionm3 of mud, sand, and gravel since 1927, reducing downstream sediment fluxes and contributing to erosion of the river's coastal delta. The removal of the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams, initiated in September 2011, induced massive increases in river sediment supply and provided an unprecedented opportunity to examine the geomorphic response of a coastal delta to these increases. Detailed measurements of beach topography and nearshore bathymetry show that {\~{}}2.5millionm3 of sediment was deposited during the first two years of dam removal, which is {\~{}}100 times greater than deposition rates measured prior to dam removal. The majority of the deposit was located in the intertidal and shallow subtidal region immediately offshore of the river mouth and was composed of sand and gravel. Additional areas of deposition include a secondary sandy deposit to the east of the river mouth and a muddy deposit west of the mouth. A comparison with fluvial sediment fluxes suggests that {\~{}}70{\%} of the sand and gravel and {\~{}}6{\%} of the mud supplied by the river was found in the survey area (within about 2km of the mouth). A hydrodynamic and sediment transport model, validated with in-situ measurements, shows that tidal currents interacting with the larger relict submarine delta help disperse fine sediment large distances east and west of the river mouth. The model also suggests that waves and currents erode the primary deposit located near the river mouth and transport sandy sediment eastward to form the secondary deposit. Though most of the substrate of the larger relict submarine delta was unchanged during the first two years of dam removal, portions of the seafloor close to the river mouth became finer, modifying habitats for biological communities. These results show that river restoration, like natural changes in river sediment supply, can result in rapid and substantial coastal geomorphological responses.},

abstract = {In 2009, the U.S. Geological Survey entered into a coop- erative agreement with the International Joint Commission, St. Croix River Board to do an analysis of historical small- mouth bass habitat as a function of lake level for Spednic Lake in an effort to quantify the effects, if any, of historical lake- level management and meteorological conditions (from 1970 to 2009) on smallmouth bass year-class failure. The analysis requires estimating habitat availability as a function of lake level during spawning periods from 1970 to 2009, which is documented in this report. Field work was done from Octo- ber 19 to 23, and from November 2 to 10, 2009, to acquire acoustic bathymetric (depth) data and acoustic data indicating the character of the surficial lake-bottom sediments. Historical lake-level data during smallmouth bass spawning (May-June) were applied to the bathymetric and surficial-sediment type data sets to produce annual historic estimates of smallmouth- bass-spawning-habitat area. Results show that minimum lake level during the spawning period explained most of the variability (R2 = 0.89) in available spawning habitat for nearshore areas of shallow slope (less than 10 degrees) on the basis of linear correlation. The change in lake level during the spawning period explained most of the variability (R2 = 0.90) in available spawning habitat for areas of steeper slopes (10 to 40 degrees) on the basis of linear correlation. The next step in modeling historic smallmouth bass year-class persistence is to combine this analysis of the effects of lake-level management on habitat availability with meteorological conditions.

abstract = {Dam removals with unmanaged sediment releases are good opportunities to learn about channel response to abruptly increased bed material supply. Understanding these events is important because they affect aquatic habitats and human uses of floodplains. A longstanding paradigm in geomorphology holds that response rates to landscape disturbance exponentially decay through time. However, a previous study of the Merrimack Village Dam (MVD) removal on the Souhegan River in New Hampshire, USA, showed that an exponential function poorly described the early geomorphic response. Erosion of impounded sediments there was two-phased. We had an opportunity to quantitatively test the two-phase response model proposed for MVD by extending the record there and comparing it with data from the Simkins Dam removal on the Patapsco River in Maryland, USA. The watershed sizes are the same order of magnitude (102km2), and at both sites low-head dams were removed ({\~{}}3–4m) and {\~{}}65 000m3 of sand-sized sediments were discharged to low-gradient reaches. Analyzing four years of repeat morphometry and sediment surveys at the Simkins site, as well as continuous discharge and turbidity data, we observed the two-phase erosion response described for MVD. In the early phase, approximately 50{\%} of the impounded sediment at Simkins was eroded rapidly during modest flows. After incision to base level and widening, a second phase began when further erosion depended on floods large enough to go over bank and access impounded sediments more distant from the newly-formed channel. Fitting functional forms to the data for both sites, we found that two-phase exponential models with changing decay constants fit the erosion data better than single-phase models. Valley width influences the two-phase erosion responses upstream, but downstream responses appear more closely related to local gradient, sediment re-supply from the upstream impoundments, and base flows.

abstract = {Water, sediment, and large wood (LW) are the three key components of dynamic river-floodplain ecosystems. We examined variations in sediment and LW discharge with respect to precipitation, the presence of dams, land and river use change, and related channel incision and forest expansion on gravel bars and floodplains across Japan. The results indicated that unit sediment discharge and unit LW discharge were smaller in southern Japan where precipitation intensity is generally much greater. Effective precipitation, an index that takes current and antecedent precipitation into account, was a strong predictor of discharge in small watersheds, but not in larger watersheds. However, precipitation intensities related to unit sediment discharge in intermediate and large watersheds were smaller than those associated with unit LW discharge, which we attribute to differences in particle shape and size and also transport mechanisms. The relationship between river flow and discharge of sediment and LW lead us to posit that discharges of these components are supply limited in southern Japan and transport limited in northern Japan. The cross-sectional mean low-flow bed elevation of gravel-bed and sand-bed rivers in Japan decreased by {\~{}}. 0.71 and 0.74. m on average, respectively, over the period 1960-2000. Forest expansion on bars and floodplains has been prominent since the 1990s, and trees apparently began to colonize gravel bars {\~{}}. 10 to 20. years after riverbed degradation began. Forest recovery in headwater basins, dam construction, gravel mining, and channelization over the past half century are likely the dominant factors that significantly reduced downstream sediment delivery, thereby promoting channel incision and forest expansion. Changes in rivers and floodplains associated with channel incision and forest expansion alter the assemblages of aquatic and terrestrial organisms in riverine landscapes of Japan, and climate change may contribute to this change by intensified precipitation. Additionally, regime shifts of water, sediment, and LW may continue or they may reach a dynamic state of quasi-equilibrium in the future. Continued monitoring of these three components, taking into account their geographic variation, is critical for anticipating and managing future changes in river-floodplain systems in Japan and around the world.},

abstract = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action - 'Water for Life' - 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01{\%} of the World's water and approximately 0.8{\%} of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100000 species out of approximately 1.8 million - almost 6{\%} of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the 'Water for Life' decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as 'receivers' of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed 'reconciliation ecology'.},

abstract = {Domestic public debate continues over the economic impacts of environmental regulations that require environmental restoration. This debate has occurred in the absence of broad-scale empirical research on economic output and employment resulting from environmental restoration, restoration-related conservation, and mitigation actions — the activities that are part of what we term the “restoration economy.” In this article, we provide a high-level accounting of the size and scope of the restoration economy in terms of employment, value added, and overall economic output on a national scale. We conducted a national survey of businesses that participate in restoration work in order to estimate the total sales and number of jobs directly associated with the restoration economy, and to provide a profile of this nascent sector in terms of type of restoration work, industrial classification, workforce needs, and growth potential. We use survey results as inputs into a national input-output model (IMPLAN 3.1) in order to estimate the indirect and induced economic impacts of restoration activities. Based on this analysis we conclude that the domestic ecological restoration sector directly employs {\~{}} 126,000 workers and generates {\~{}} {\$}9.5 billion in economic output (sales) annually.

abstract = {Abstract Restoration activities intended to improve the condition of streams and rivers are widespread throughout the Upper Midwest, U.S.A. As with other regions, however, little information exists regarding types of activities and their effectiveness. We developed a database of 1,345 stream restoration projects implemented from the years 1970 to 2004 for the states of Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin in order to analyze regional trends in goals, presence of monitoring, spatial distribution, size, and cost of river restoration projects. We found that data on individual projects were fragmented across multiple federal, state, and county agencies, as well as nonprofit groups and consulting firms. The most common restoration goals reported for this region were in-stream habitat improvement, bank stabilization, water-quality management, and dam removal. The former two were most common in Michigan and Wisconsin, where salmonid fisheries enhancement appeared to be an important concern, whereas water-quality management was most frequent in Ohio. The most common restoration activities were the use of sand traps and riprap, and other common activities were related to the improvement of fish habitat. The median cost was {\$}12,957 for projects with cost data, and total expenditures since 1990 were estimated at {\$}444 million. Over time, the cost of individual projects has increased, whereas the median size has decreased, suggesting that restoration resources are being spent on smaller, more localized, and more expensive projects. Only 11{\%} of data records indicated that monitoring was performed, and more expensive projects were more likely to be monitored. Standardization of monitoring and record keeping and dissemination of findings are urgently needed to ensure that dollars are well spent and restoration effectiveness is maximized.},

abstract = {The main objective of this study is to take advantage of spatial altimetry data to help monitoring river discharges in poorly gauged basins. A methodology is defined to obtain high accuracy relationships between water levels provided by spatial altimetry and water discharge computed by a hydrological model. The proposed method is based on a distributed rainfall-runoff model calibrated and validated against a few in situ data. Discharge is modeled in a daily time step at river locations tracked by the satellite and combined with water height observations to produce rating curves. The methodology is evaluated in the Northern Amazon basin, corresponding to the upper part of the Branco River basin, the major tributary of the Negro River. The MGB-IPH (an acronym from the Portuguese for Large Basins Model and Institute of Hydraulic Research) is run for a 10-year period, from January 1997 to December 2006, in a daily time step. Eight gauge stations are used to calibrate and validate the model, resulting in Nash-Sutcliffe coefficients from 0.47 (Maloca do Cont{\~{a}}o station - 5896 km2) to 0.85 (Caracara{\'{i}} station - 126,085 km2) in the calibration process, and 0.42 (Posto Funai station - 9708 km2) to 0.94 (also at Caracara{\'{i}} station) in the validation process. Results suggest the existence of relations between model accuracy and the size of drainage areas, which can be firstly attributed to a poor rainfall monitoring and also to model restrictions, which was specially developed to large basins. Water level time series (35-day time step) at 12 virtual stations (VS) are deduced from ENVISAT tracks from October 2002 to November 2006. The rating curve parameters, including the zero-flow depth (h), are estimated by fitting a power-law relation between modeled discharges and satellite-derived water altimetry. Zero-flow depths are optimized for each VS in order to define the best fitted curve. Additionally, slopes along reaches where two or more VS's are defined can be provided. Comparisons between daily water discharges provided by in situ observations and rating curve estimates at three VS's resulted in RMS errors from 9.9{\%} to 26.9{\%}, which are in accordance with previous experiences and acceptable for most hydrological applications. River bed slopes derived from both ENVISAT and SRTM were compared. Results suggest that altimetric data provide more accurate slopes and it should be preferred whenever it is available. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Roads are a widespread and increasing feature of most landscapes. We reviewed the scientific liter- ature on the ecological effects of roads and found support for the general conclusion that they are associated with negative effects on biotic integrity in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Roads of all kinds have seven general effects: mortality from road construction, mortality from collision with vehicles, modification of animal behavior, alteration of the physical environment, alteration of the chemical environment, spread of exotics, and increased use of areas by humans. Road construction kills sessile and slow-moving organisms, injures organisms adjacent to a road, and alters physical conditions beneath a road. Vehicle collisions affect the demography of many species, both vertebrates and invertebrates; mitigation measures to reduce roadkill have been only partly successful. Roads alter animal behavior by causing changes in home ranges, move- ment, reproductive success, escape response, and physiological state. Roads change soil density, temperature, soil water content, light levels, dust, surface waters, patterns of runoff, and sedimentation, as well as adding heavy metals (especially lead), salts, organic molecules, ozone, and nutrients to roadside environments. Roads promote the dispersal of exotic species by altering habitats, stressing native species, and providing movement corridors. Roads also promote increased hunting, fishing, passive harassment of animals, and landscape modifications. Not all species and ecosystems are equally affected by roads, but overall the pres- ence of roads is highly correlated with changes in species composition, population sizes, and hydrologic and geomorphic processes that shape aquatic and riparian systems. More experimental research is needed to com- plement post-hoc correlative studies. Our review underscores the importance to conservation of avoiding con- struction of new roads in roadless or sparsely roaded areas and of removal or restoration of existing roads to benefit both terrestrial and aquatic biota.},

The existing literature also shows that restoration investments lead to significant positive economic and employment impacts and appear to have particularly localized benefits, which can be attributed to the tendency for projects to employ local labor and materials. While these initial figures are promising, the extent of environmental restoration activities and benefits at a national level is not yet well understood. Our findings reveal the need for a methodological framework for more accurately and broadly estimating the size of the U.S. restoration sector and its impact on the U.S. economy.},

abstract = {Wavelet analysis is a powerful tool with which to analyse the hydrologic effects of dam construction and operation on river systems. Using continuous records of instantaneous discharge from the Lees Ferry gauging station and records of daily mean discharge from upstream tributaries, we conducted wavelet analyses of the hydrologic structure of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon. The wavelet power spectrum (WPS) of daily mean discharge provided a highly compressed and integrative picture of the post-dam elimination of pronounced annual and sub-annual flow features. The WPS of the continuous record showed the influence of diurnal and weekly power generation cycles, shifts in discharge management, and the 1996 experimental flood in the post-dam period. Normalization of the WPS by local wavelet spectra revealed the fine structure of modulation in discharge scale and amplitude and provides an extremely efficient tool with which to assess the relationships among hydrologic cycles and ecological and geomorphic systems. We extended our analysis to sections of the Snake River and showed how wavelet analysis can be used as a data mining technique. The wavelet approach is an especially promising tool with which to assess dam operation in less well-studied regions and to evaluate management attempts to reconstruct desired flow characteristics.

abstract = {Nil{\"{u}}fer Stream is an important water source in the industrial and metropolitan city of Bursa, Turkey. The stream catchment has been influenced by high human impact. The downstream receives sewage water from households and industry, whereas the headwater of the stream has a source of high-quality drinkable water. In this paper, abundances of epipelic diatom taxa, faecal coliforms (FC), total coliforms (TC) and total bacteria (TB) were studied in relation to measured environmental variables (T, pH, DO, BOD(5), EC, TDS) for the period July 1997 to June 1998 at six stations in the heavily polluted Nil{\"{u}}fer Stream catchment. It is observed that the physicochemical variables and bacterial abundances varied seasonally at all stations, and the level of pollution reached at its highest point in the summer. The results of Kruskal-Wallis and one-way ANOVA indicated that DO gradually decreased, whereas BOD(5), EC, TDS, TB, FC and TC gradually increased from upstream to downstream. The ordination method of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was carried out for both biologic and physicochemical variables, and the results were supported by the former statistical procedures. The frequency of occurrence of dominant diatoms was examined in relation to the spatial variations in chemical constituents. Both diatoms and bacteria showed strong correlations with the measured physicochemical variables. In Canonical Correlation Analysis (CANCORR) measures of bacterial abundances also displayed strong correlations with abundances of 11 diatom taxa. The results showed that the stream catchment is polluted gradually from upstream to downstream. In addition, pollution load in the stream catchment has been gradually increased, compared with recent years. Urbanisation and industrialisation of the city have affected increasing pollution in Nil{\"{u}}fer Stream. The results also indicated that diatoms are not affected by environmental variables such as bacteria. Bacteria are more sensitive to organic pollution, while diatoms are indicators of different environmental conditions.},

abstract = {While the abiotic factors important to freshwater fish assemblages at a reach scale are well understood, studies of larger scale constraints have yielded variable conclusions, spurring a need for further studies in new biogeographic contexts. This study investigated the importance of catchment- and reach-scale abiotic factors to variation in freshwater fish assemblages in rivers of northeastern Mesoamerica. Abiotic variables and fish data from 72 sampling sites on main stem rivers of Belize were used with partial constrained ordination to determine the proportion of spatially structured and unstructured variation in fish presence and absence, relative abundance, and community metrics explained by catchment- and reach-scale environmental factors. Results showed that, combined, catchment and reach variables explained a large portion of the total variation in the fish assemblage data (54–75{\%}), and that catchment environment explained a greater portion of variation (42–63{\%}) than reach environment (34–50{\%}). Variables representing landscape position (local elevation, watershed area) and their reach-level correlates (channel width, depth variation, and substrate) correlated strongly to the fish assemblage data. Our results suggest that landscape-scale factors have a stronger relative influence on assemblages than environmental conditions at the reach scale within our study area. These results contrast with past findings that showed greater local scale influence in landscapes with low anthropogenic disturbance levels. Our findings suggest that biodiversity conservation efforts should consider assemblage variation across a longitudinal gradient, and that a multi-catchment region is a biologically relevant scale for fish conservation planning and coordination in northeastern Mesoamerica.},

abstract = {Assessing species vulnerability to environmental changes is a major challenge for conservation. Combinations of biological attributes have already been successfully used for this purpose, allowing large-scale prediction of inter-specific differences in demographic parameters (e.g. abundance) or endangered status. However, studies investigating whether biological attributes could be used to predict the temporal demographic responses of species in a changing environment are still scarce. In this work, we tackled this issue by taking advantage of a multi-decadal survey of concomitant changes in fish communities and environmental conditions within the Terminos lagoon (Mexico). Based on this rare dataset, we first characterized changes in abiotic parameters that occurred in this ecosystem since the 80s. Then, we adapted a multivariate index accounting for changes in both species abundance and occurrence to assess concomitant demographic changes for the 25 dominant fish species in the lagoon, classifying them into five various types of trajectories ("Increasing" , "Decreasing", "Constant", "Hump-shape" and "U-shape"). Finally, we assessed the accuracy in prediction of these temporal responses for all possible combinations of 15 biological attributes including taxonomy, ecological and life-history traits. Our results showed that fish specific demographic changes over the last 30 years could be accurately predicted (72{\%} accuracy) using a combination of five biological attributes (spawning season, order, maximum salinity, width of salinity range, oocyte size) among which three could be related to the increase in average salinity occurred in the lagoon over this period. Appropriate sets of complementary biological attributes could similarly allow prediction of inter-specific differences in demographic changes in other areas, thereby offering an additional pragmatic tool for ecosystem managers to identify vulnerable species at the local scale. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In place for over 95 years, the dams have contributed to changes in the river, its estuary, and marine areas off shore from the river mouth, largely through reductions in sediment supply and salmon populations. Impending removals of both dams will only restore part of the severely degraded Elwha nearshore, where additional large scale anthropogenic impacts will remain. The effects of lower river levees, marine bluff hardening including significant riprapping of the marine shoreline, among other lesser habitat alterations, will continue beyond dam removal. Understanding the relationship of dam removal to the adjacent nearshore area is critical to the design of additional work necessary for successful ecosystem recovery. We provide an overview of the Elwha nearshore and collaborative efforts underway to understand it, and the role it plays in ecosystem restoration.

The ENVISAT Geophysical Data Records products contain, over different type of surfaces, altimeter ranges derived from four specialized algorithms or retrackers. However, none of the retrackers are intended to the processing of the radar echoes over continental waters. A validation study is necessary to assess the performances of the different ENVISAT-derived water levels to monitor inland waters. We have selected four test-zones over the Amazon basin to achieve this validation study. We compare first the performances of these retracking algorithms to deliver reliable water levels for land hydrology. Comparisons with in-situ gauge stations showed that Ice-1 algorithm, based on the Offset Centre of Gravity technique, provides the more accurate water stages.

The occurrence, type, and severity of streamflow alteration differed markedly between arid and wet climates. Biological assessments conducted on a subset of these streams showed that, relative to eight chemical and physical covariates, diminished flow magnitudes were the primary predictors of biological integrity for fish and macroinvertebrate communities. In addition, the likelihood of biological impairment dou- bled with increasing severity of diminished streamflows. Among streams with diminished flow magnitudes, increasingly common fish and macroinvertebrate taxa possessed traits characteristic of lake or pond habitats, including a preference for fine-grained substrates and slow-moving currents, as well as the ability to temporarily leave the aquatic environment.},

In this study we use a high-resolution ground-based camera system with near-infrared sensitivity to quantify the immediate response of riparian vegetation in an Alpine, gravel bed, braided river to flood disturbance with the use of vegetation indices. Five large floods with return periods between 1.4 and 20.1 years in the period 2008–2011 in the Maggia River were analysed to evaluate patterns of vegetation response in three distinct floodplain units (main bar, secondary bar, transitional zone) and to compare the sensitivity of seven broadband vegetation indices. The results show both a negative (damage) and positive (enhancement) response of vegetation within 1 week following the floods, with a selective impact determined by pre-flood vegetation vigour, geomorphological setting and intensity of the flood forcing. The spatial distribution of vegetation damage provides a coherent picture of floodplain response in the three floodplain units. The vegetation indices tested in a riverine environment with highly variable surface wetness, high gravel reflectance, and extensive water–soil–vegetation contact zones differ in the direction of predicted change and its spatial distribution in the range 0.7–35.8{\%}. We conclude that vegetation response to flood disturbance may be effectively monitored by terrestrial photography with near-infrared sensitivity, with potential for long-term assessment in river management and restoration projects.},

abstract = {Removal of two dams 32m and 64m high on the Elwha River, Washington, USA, provided the first opportunity to examine river response to a dam removal and controlled sediment influx on such a large scale. Although many recent river-restoration efforts have included dam removal, large dam removals have been rare enough that their physical and ecological effects remain poorly understood. New sedimentary deposits that formed during this multi-stage dam removal result from a unique, artificially created imbalance between fluvial sediment supply and transport capacity. River flows during dam removal were essentially natural and included no large floods in the first twoyears, while draining of the two reservoirs greatly increased the sediment supply available for fluvial transport. The resulting sedimentary deposits exhibited substantial spatial heterogeneity in thickness, stratal-formation patterns, grain size and organic content. Initial mud deposition in the first year of dam removal filled pore spaces in the pre-dam-removal cobble bed, potentially causing ecological disturbance but not aggrading the bed substantially at first. During the second winter of dam removal, thicker and in some cases coarser deposits replaced the early mud deposits. By 18months into dam removal, channel-margin and floodplain deposits were commonly {\textgreater}0.5m thick and, contrary to pre-dam-removal predictions that silt and clay would bypass the river system, included average mud content around 20{\%}. Large wood and lenses of smaller organic particles were common in the new deposits, presumably contributing additional carbon and nutrients to the ecosystem downstream of the dam sites. Understanding initial sedimentary response to the Elwha River dam removals will inform subsequent analyses of longer-term sedimentary, geomorphic and ecosystem changes in this fluvial and coastal system, and will provide important lessons for other river-restoration efforts where large dam removal is planned or proposed.

abstract = {Defining critical source areas (CSAs) of diffuse pollution in agricultural catchments depends upon the accurate delineation of hydrologically sensitive areas (HSAs) at highest risk of generating surface runoff pathways. In topographically complex landscapes, this delineation is constrained by digital elevation model (DEM) resolution and the influence of microtopographic features. To address this, optimal DEM resolutions and point densities for spatially modelling HSAs were investigated, for onward use in delineating CSAs. The surface runoff framework was modelled using the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) and maps were derived from 0.25m LiDAR DEMs (40 bare-earth points m−2), resampled 1m and 2m LiDAR DEMs, and a radar generated 5m DEM. Furthermore, the resampled 1m and 2m LiDAR DEMs were regenerated with reduced bare-earth point densities (5, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 points m−2) to analyse effects on elevation accuracy and important microtopographic features. Results were compared to surface runoff field observations in two 10km2 agricultural catchments for evaluation. Analysis showed that the accuracy of modelled HSAs using different thresholds (5{\%}, 10{\%} and 15{\%} of the catchment area with the highest TWI values) was much higher using LiDAR data compared to the 5m DEM (70–100{\%} and 10–84{\%}, respectively). This was attributed to the DEM capturing microtopographic features such as hedgerow banks, roads, tramlines and open agricultural drains, which acted as topographic barriers or channels that diverted runoff away from the hillslope scale flow direction. Furthermore, the identification of ‘breakthrough' and ‘delivery' points along runoff pathways where runoff and mobilised pollutants could be potentially transported between fields or delivered to the drainage channel network was much higher using LiDAR data compared to the 5m DEM (75–100{\%} and 0–100{\%}, respectively). Optimal DEM resolutions of 1–2m were identified for modelling HSAs, which balanced the need for microtopographic detail as well as surface generalisations required to model the natural hillslope scale movement of flow. Little loss of vertical accuracy was observed in 1–2m LiDAR DEMs with reduced bare-earth point densities of 2–5 points m−2, even at hedgerows. Further improvements in HSA models could be achieved if soil hydrological properties and the effects of flow sinks (filtered out in TWI models) on hydrological connectivity are also considered.},

abstract = {The hydrology and geomorphology of large rivers in America reflect the pervasive influence of an extensive water control infrastructure including more than 75,000??dams. One hundred thirty-seven of the very large dams, each storing 1.2??km3 (106??acre feet) of water or more, alter the flows of every large river in the country. The hydrologic effects of these very large dams emerge from an analysis of the stream gage records of 72 river reaches organized into 36 pairs. One member of each pair is an unregulated reach above a dam, whereas the other is a regulated reach downstream from the same structure. Comparison of the regulated and unregulated reaches shows that very large dams, on average, reduce annual peak discharges 67{\%} (in some individual cases up to 90{\%}), decrease the ratio of annual maximum/mean flow 60{\%}, decrease the range of daily discharges 64{\%}, increase the number of reversals in discharge by 34{\%}, and reduce the daily rates of ramping as much as 60{\%}. Dams alter the timing of high and low flows and change the timing of the yearly maximum and minimum flows, in some cases by as much as half a year. Regional variation in rivers, dams, and responses are substantial: rivers in the Great Plains and Ozark/Ouachita regions have annual maximum/mean flow ratios that are 7 times greater than ratios for rivers in the Pacific Northwest. At the same time, the ratio of storage capacity/mean annual water yield for dams is greatest for Interior Western, Ozark/Ouachita and Great Plains rivers and least for Pacific Northwest streams. Thus, in many cases those rivers with the highest annual variability have the greatest potential impact from dams because structures can exert substantial control over downstream hydrology. The hydrologic changes by dams have fostered dramatic geomorphic differences between regulated and unregulated reaches. When compared to similar unregulated reaches, regulated reaches have 32{\%} larger low flow channels, 50{\%} smaller high flow channels, 79{\%} less active flood plain area, and 3.6 times more inactive flood plain area. Dams also affect the area of active areas, the functional surfaces that are functionally connected to the present regime of the river. Regulated reaches have active areas that are 72 smaller than the active areas of similar unregulated reaches. The geomorphic complexity (number of separate functional surfaces per unit of channel length) is 37{\%} less in regulated reaches. Reductions in the size of hydrologically active functional surfaces are greatest in rivers in the Great Plains and least in Eastern streams. The largest differences in geomorphic complexity are in interior western rivers. The shrunken, simplified geomorphology of regulated large rivers has had direct effects on riparian ecology, producing spatially smaller, less diverse riparian ecosystems compared to the larger, more complex ecosystems along unregulated reaches of rivers. ?? 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {When a humid region is affected by arid climate, significant changes in drought characteristics occur due to imbalance of water budget. In this study, change in drought characteristics according to shift of different climates i.e. tropical, warm temperate, cold and polar to Arid Climate (SAC) was analyzed over the Asia monsoon region. Climate zones and the SAC regions were identified by applying the K{\"{o}}ppen climate classification on hydro-meteorological data for the period of 1963-2006. The analysis of hydro-meteorological parameters revealed that the annual precipitation and runoff in the SAC regions appeared to decrease about 12.1{\%} and 27.3{\%}, respectively, while annual average temperature increased about 0.5. °C. Standardized runoff index (SRI) was calculated using model-driven runoff data. The trend and change point analyses of SRI were performed to evaluate the changes in drought characteristics (frequency, duration, severity) before and after shifting of the different climates to arid climate. The results revealed strong decreasing trend of SRI and hence intensified drought conditions for the SAC regions. A change point year of drought occurred about 3-5. years earlier than the shifting time of the SAC region. Frequency and duration of droughts in the SAC regions were observed to increase about 9.2 and 1.5. months, respectively, and drought severity index intensified to about -0.15. It can be concluded that analysis of shifting to arid climate zones should be considered together with changes in drought characteristics, because the drought characteristics and changing arid climate zones are closely related to each other.},

abstract = {Facilities that produce hydroelectricity by diversion of part of the river's flow, which are often considered to have lower environmental impact than conventional hydropower dams, are being built in large numbers on river systems throughout the world, yet their cumulative impacts are not well understood. This study evaluated the hydrological effects of operation of a diversion hydropower facility on the Correntes River in Brazil (mean discharge 73m3s-1), which is potentially important because of the ecological implications for the floodplains of the Pantanal into which it flows. Many similar dams are built or proposed on rivers feeding the Pantanal. The 210-MW facility known as Ponte de Pedra diverts part of the river flow into a diversion channel in a nearly "run-of-river" design. The natural (reconstructed) and regulated (observed) flow regimes were characterized using Indicators of Hydrologic Alteration (IHA) and Flow Duration Curves (FDC). Seven parameters of IHA were significantly altered by the reservoir formation (magnitude of lowest monthly flow, minimum flows of 1, 3 and 7days, maximum flow of 90days and counts of high and low pulses). Among these, Principal Components Analysis identified the maximum flow of 90days and the count of high flow pulses as integrators of hydrological alterations. The FDC showed that the reservoir also changed the seasonal regime of the flows, with greater changes in the lowest flow season. The reduction of river-floodplain connectivity and loss of associated ecosystem services are the major downstream ecological implications of this altered flow regime. To maintain the seasonal flooding regime while meeting the requirements for hydroelectric production, proposed limits for flow regime alterations are up to ±18{\%} in low flow, ±24{\%} in the rising limb and ±22{\%} in high flow and the falling limb, relative to the natural flow. Operational changes to maintain flows with these limits could easily be implemented because the hydrological alterations attributed to the reservoir and operations of its dam are modest compared to seasonal variation in river flow. Without attention to maintaining the natural flow regime, the cumulative effects of diversion hydropower dams like this one will significantly alter the ecohydrology of downstream rivers and floodplains.},

abstract = {Large fallen wood can have a significant impact on channel form and process in forested mountain streams. In this study, four small channels on the Fraser Experimental Forest near Fraser, Colorado, USA, were surveyed for channel geometries and largewoodloading, including the size, source, and characteristics of individual pieces. The study is part of a larger effort to understand the impact of mountain pine beetle infestation on a suite ofwa- tershed properties. Here,we present baseline data collected at the onset ofwidespread treemortality. Channels range from1.5 to 2minwidth,with slopes ranging from3 to N10{\%}.Median (D50) streambed particle sizes range from gravel to very coarse gravel. Channels are characterized as cascade, step-pool, and plane bed over varying scales. Large wood loads ranged fromabout 0.4 to 1.0 piece per meter length of channel, which is comparable to values reported for other Colorado sites.Much of thewood showed indications of being in place for long pe- riods of time (decayed/rotten, broken into ramps, and partially buried in beds and banks). Nearly all surveyed reaches contained steps formed from small boulders and/or logs. Significant portions of the elevation drop in some of the reaches were made up by log steps, though the percentages varied (0 to 60{\%}). Individual log steps trap a portion of the coarse sediment moved as bedload, forming wedge-shaped accumulations upstream of the logs. The particle size distributions for measured bedload and step accumulations largely overlapped, but more so for the coarse ends of the distributions, suggesting a trapping inefficiency for the finer component of bedload. Estimates of the total volume of sediment stored behind log stepswere approximately an order ofmag- nitude greater than the mean sediment volume exported on an annual basis, as determined frommeasured ac- cumulations in weir ponds. The particle size distribution of sediment in the ponds – ranging from sand to mediumgravel – is considerably finer than sediment stored in steps. The series of comparisons between storage volumes, particle size distributions, and sediment export suggests that log steps effectively trap coarse sediment moved in these small streams and act as a series of check dams that inhibit channel erosion, butmay be less ef- fective at trapping finer sediment (sand and small gravel).

abstract = {Riparian forests are strongly linked to stream ecosystems, and the creation and/or conservation of riparian forests can mitigate the influence of agriculture on streams. Although riparian forest buffers are commonly advocated as best management practices, the extent of forest necessary to effectively mitigate upstream agricultural effects on streams remains unresolved. To determine how soon agricultural streams exhibit detectable effects after entering forest fragments, we surveyed sixteen sites distributed across two 2nd-order headwater streams in agricultural landscapes of central Ohio that exhibit abrupt transitions as they flow from upstream agricultural land up to 1km into downstream forest fragments. Along these transitions we measured leaf-colonizing benthic macroinvertebrate assemblages, leaf-litter breakdown, and physicochemical habitat. Our results indicated that forest fragments can rapidly alter physicochemical and biological attributes of agricultural streams. At both study streams, daily maximum temperature declined within the first 200m of entering forest fragments. Changes in water quality were more variable, but there was evidence of a strong decline in NO3-N along an agriculture-forest transition. There was also evidence of a decline in fine sediment with distance into the forest at one stream. Aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblages exhibited strong changes in composition ranging from the forest edge up to 324m into forest fragments. Taxa that declined after entering forests were generally more tolerant of anthropogenic disturbance and/or those that rely on in-stream primary productivity (i.e., scrapers) whereas most of the taxa that increased after entering forests were relatively sensitive to disturbance and rely on allochthonous organic matter inputs from the forest (i.e., shredders). Collectively, the rapid changes in biological and physicochemical attributes that we observed suggest that even relatively small forest fragments may be able to markedly influence impaired streams and that conservation and restoration of small, discontinuous forest fragments may be important for maintaining stream ecosystem integrity in agricultural landscapes. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The management of Australia's water resources has, until recently, focused upon meeting the needs of consumptive users. This focus has been driven by economic impreatives, combined with a government commitment to industrial/agricultural development and expansion. While expansionary policies have produced significant economic benefits for Australia, it has become increasingly apparent that such development has come at a price. The regulation of Australian rivers has resulted in the alteration of natural flow regimes to the extent that many ecological processes have been severely disrupted. This has not only had biological repercussions, but also produced agricultural problems such as algal blooms, salinity and rising groundwater tables. The situation in which Australian water managers find themselves is, therefore, one in which competing demands and limited resources combine to place them in an often untenable position. The key issue with which such managers must grapple is how to trade off environmental and consumptive water needs. In order to examine the types of difficulties and challenges which face these managers, this account seeks to outline the key impediments to managing water for the environment efficiently and effectively. In so doing it reviews the complicated, and often controversial, condition within which decisions about water management are currently being made. It also seeks to alert future and existing environmental water manager to the experiences of others in their industry.},

Benthic macroinvertebrates, diatoms and fish indices have been used to determine the ecological status of 1100 sites of the monitoring network distributed homogeneously over national territory. The pressures taken into account to explain and predict ecological status cover three spatial scales: catchment, reach, site. The set of predictive data cover three types of pressure: land use pressure, hydromorphological pressure and physico-chemical pressure measured at catchment, reach and site scale, respectively. We showed that the parameters characterising the load of nutrients and organic matter had a predominant effect on the three biological compartments, and that land use variables played an integrating role of the different pressures acting on rivers and explained a major part of their degradation. On the contrary, we also showed that it was more difficult to characterise the role of the hydromorphological descriptors measured at the intermediate scale of the reach due to the difficulty of characterising the links between scales. The three predictive models developed demonstrated good performances to evaluate biological condition and are of great interest for managers as it permits using a set of pressure data to successively predict the status of water bodies for which biological monitoring data are unavailable. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Based on its geomorphological characteristics, we divided this zone into three types that have hillside profiles with distinct shapes and gradients, grain components and sizes, and land uses. Although the three types of the zone have experienced the same set of geomorphological processes under the new annually cyclic hydrological regime, their responses and the associated morphologies are distinguishable. Thus we depicted them separately. Accompanied with these processes are geochemical and biological processes that bring about exacerbated pollution and destroyed ecosystem in this zone.

abstract = {. We define disturbance in stream ecosystems to be: any relatively discrete event in time that is characterized by a frequency, intensity, and severity outside a predictable range, and that disrupts ecosystem, community, or population structure and changes resources or the physical environment. Of the three major hypotheses relating disturbance to lotic community structure, the dynamic equilibrium hypothesis appears to be generally applicable, although specific studies support the intermediate disturbance hypothesis and the equilibrium model. Differences in disturbance frequency between lentic and lotic systems may explain why biotic interactions are more apparent in lakes than in streams. Responses to both natural and anthropogenic disturbances vary regionally, as illustrated by examples from the mid-continent, Pacific northwest, and southeastern United States. Based on a generalized framework of climatic-biogeochemical characteristics, two features are considered to be most significant in choosing streams for comparative studies of disturbance: hydrologic regimes and comparable geomorphology. A method is described for quantifying predictability of the hy- drologic regime based on long-term records of monthly maximum and minimum stream flows. Different channel forms (boulder and cobble, alluvial gravelbed, alluvial sandbed) have different responses to hydrologic disturbance from spates. A number of structural and functional components for comparing disturbance effects within regions and across biomes are presented. Experimental approaches to studying disturbance involve spatial-scale considerations, logistic difficulties, and ethical questions.

abstract = {The plants and animals that inhabit river channels may act as zoogeomorphic agents affecting the nature and rates of sediment recruitment, transport and deposition. The impact of benthic-feeding fish, which disturb bed material sediments during their search for food, has received very little attention, even though benthic feeding species are widespread in rivers and may collectively expend significant amounts of energy foraging across the bed. An ex situ experiment was conducted to investigate the impact of a benthic feeding fish (Barbel Barbus barbus) on particle displacements, bed sediment structures, gravel entrainment and transport fluxes. In a laboratory flume changes in bed surface topography were measured and grain displacements examined when an imbricated, water-worked bed of 5.6 to 16 mm gravels was exposed to feeding juvenile Barbel (on average, 0.195 m in length). Grain entrainment rates and bedload fluxes were measured under a moderate transport regime for substrates that had been exposed to feeding fish and control substrates which had not. On average, approximately 37{\%} of the substrate, by area, was modified by foraging fish during a four-hour treatment period, resulting in increased microtopographic roughness and reduced particle imbrication. Structural changes by fish corresponded with an average increase in bedload flux of 60{\%} under entrainment flows, whilst on average the total number of grains transported during the entrainment phase was 82{\%} higher from substrates that had been disturbed by Barbel. Together, these results indicate that by increasing surface microtopography and undoing the naturally stable structures produced by water working, foraging can increase the mobility of gravel-bed materials. An interesting implication of this result is that by increasing the quantity of available, transportable sediment and lowering entrainment thresholds, benthic feeding might affect bedload fluxes in gravel-bed rivers. The evidence presented here is sufficient to suggest that further investigation of this possibility is warranted. {\textcopyright} 2014 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Fluvial geomorphology has been the largest single subdiscipline within geomorphology for many decades. Fluvial geomorphic expertise is integral to understanding and managing rivers and to developing strategies for sustainable development. This paper provides an overview of some of the significant advances in fluvial geomorphology between 1960 and 2010 with respect to: conceptual models; fluvial features and environments being studied; tools used by fluvial geomorphologists; geomorphic specialty groups within professional societies; journals in which fluvial geomorphic research is published; and textbooks of fluvial geomorphology. During this half century, fluvial geomorphology broadened considerably in scope, from a focus primarily on physical principles underlying process and form in lower gradient channels with limited grain size range, to a more integrative view of rivers as ecosystems with nonlinear behavior and great diversity of gradient, substrate composition, and grain size. The array of tools for making basic observations, analyzing data, and disseminating research results also expanded considerably during this period, as did the diversity of the fluvial geomorphic community. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Recently, widespread valley-bottom damming for water power was identified as a primary control on valley sedimentation in the mid-Atlantic US during the late seventeenth to early twentieth century. The timing of damming coincided with that of accelerated upland erosion during post-European settlement land-use change. In this paper, we examine the impact of local drops in base level on incision into historic reservoir sediment as thousands of ageing dams breach. Analysis of lidar and field data indicates that historic milldam building led to local base-level rises of 2-5 m (typical milldam height) and reduced valley slopes by half. Subsequent base-level fall with dam breaching led to an approximate doubling in slope, a significant base-level forcing. Case studies in forested, rural as well as agricultural and urban areas demonstrate that a breached dam can lead to stream incision, bank erosion and increased loads of suspended sediment, even with no change in land use. After dam breaching, key predictors of stream bank erosion include number of years since dam breach, proximity to a dam and dam height. One implication of this work is that conceptual models linking channel condition and sediment yield exclusively with modern upland land use are incomplete for valleys impacted by milldams. With no equivalent in the Holocene or late Pleistocene sedimentary record, modern incised stream-channel forms in the mid-Atlantic region represent a transient response to both base-level forcing and major changes in land use beginning centuries ago. Similar channel forms might also exist in other locales where historic milling was prevalent.},

abstract = {Benthic foraging by fish can modify the nature and rates of fine sediment accrual and the structure and topography of coarse-grained fluvial substrates, with the potential to alter bed material characteristics, particle entrainment thresholds, and bedload transport fluxes. However, knowledge of what controls the nature, extent, and intensity of benthic foraging and the consequent influence of these controls on geomorphic impact remain rudimentary. An ex-situ experiment utilising Barbel Barbus barbus and Chub Leuciscus cephalus extended previous work by considering the role of fish size and species as controls of sediment disturbance by foraging and the implications for bed material characteristics and bedload transport. In a laboratory flume, changes in bed microtopography and structure were measured when a water-worked bed of 5.6-22.6. mm gravels was exposed to four size classes of Barbel (4-5???, 5-6???, 6-8???, 8-10??? in length) and a single size class of Chub (8-10???). In line with other studies that have investigated animal size as a control of zoogeomorphic agency, increasing the size of Barbel had a significant effect on measured disturbance and transport metrics. Specifically, the area of disturbed substrate, foraging depth, and the fish's impact on microtopographic roughness and imbrication all increased as a function of fish size. In a comparison of the foraging effects of like-sized Barbel and Chub, 8-10??? in length, Barbel foraged a larger area of the test bed and had a greater impact on microtopographic roughness and sediment structure. Relative to water-worked beds that were not foraged, bed conditioning by both species was associated with increased bedload transport during the subsequent application of high flows. However, the bedload flux after foraging by Barbel, which is a specialist benthivore, was 150{\%} higher than that following foraging by Chub, which feed opportunistically from the bed, and the total transported mass of sediment was 98{\%} greater. An interesting implication of these results, given the abundance and widespread distribution of foraging fish, is that numerous fish species belonging to a variety of functional groups may be acting as zoogeomorphic agents in rivers, directly affecting bed material conditions and sediment transport fluxes in proportion to their body size and feeding traits.},

abstract = {Human influence on the Earth System and hydrologic cycle has reached the point where it affects the hydrologic balance between ocean and continental storage reservoirs. The anthropogenic redistribution of water mass at a planetary scale even has an effect on Earth rotation parameters. Land use changes associated with expanding agriculture to support an increasing human population have already had a profound influence on basin-scale hydrology, and in extreme cases, on regional climate. Major human activities which lead to hydrologic alterations include irrigation (from ground water mining and surface water diversion), deforestation, wetland filling or drainage, and new dam construction. With the exception of the latter, these all contribute to the transfer of water from the continents to the ocean and a reduction of continental water resources. However, water impoundment behind dams may partially or completely counteract the cumulative effect of the others. Present compilations of reservoirs impounded by dams include only the results of major engineering projects. Smaller impoundments have largely been ignored. The cumulative volume of the literally millions of small reservoirs such as farm ponds and rice paddies may approach that of the larger documented reservoirs. Unfortunately it is not practical to make a global inventory of millions of small and unregistered reservoirs, so their volume may never be known precisely. The quantity of water stored in artifically raised water tables behind dams has also not yet been addressed. The issue of water impoundment or release from continental drainage basins affects global sea level. Recent estimates based solely on major dammed reservoirs suggest that if new dam construction is not maintained at the rates of the 1960s through 1980s, the rate of sea level rise could increase by about half a millimeter per year. If small impoundments are taken into account this figure could be much greater. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

abstract = {One of the most uncertain modeling tasks in hydrology is the prediction of ungauged stream sediment load and concentration statistics. This study presents integrated artificial neural networks (ANN) models for prediction of sediment rating curve parameters (rating curve coefficient $\alpha$ and rating curve exponent $\beta$) for ungauged basins. The ANN models integrate a comprehensive list of input parameters to improve the accuracy achieved; the input parameters used include: soil, land use, topographic, climatic, and hydrometric data sets. The ANN models were trained on the randomly selected 2/3 of the dataset of 94 gauged streams in Ontario, Canada and validated on the remaining 1/3. The developed models have high correlation coefficients of 0.92 and 0.86 for $\alpha$ and $\beta$, respectively. The ANN model for the rating coefficient $\alpha$ is directly proportional to rainfall erosivity factor, soil erodibility factor, and apportionment entropy disorder index, whereas it is inversely proportional to vegetation cover and mean annual snowfall. The ANN model for the rating exponent $\beta$ is directly proportional to mean annual precipitation, the apportionment entropy disorder index, main channel slope, standard deviation of daily discharge, and inversely proportional to the fraction of basin area covered by wetlands and swamps. Sediment rating curves are essential tools for the calculation of sediment load, concentration-duration curve (CDC), and concentration-duration-frequency (CDF) analysis for more accurate assessment of water quality for ungauged basins.},

abstract = {Crayfish are one of the most prolific freshwater invaders, yet the role of crayfish as ecosystem engineers that structure benthic substrates in their nonnative habitat is rarely studied. We used an in situ experimental manipulation to document changes in sediment dynamics and macroinvertebrate density and richness caused by the presence or absence of invasive rusty crayfish (Orconectes rusticus). Rusty crayfish reduced fine-sediment accumulation and increased pit and mound structures in the river bed by moving gravels at the bed surface. We predicted that this omnivorous species would directly reduce macroinvertebrate density and richness, but we found that macroinvertebrate density was higher in treatments with rusty crayfish present and that macroinvertebrate richness did not differ between treatments with and without crayfish. Our findings suggest that rusty crayfish, which are spreading throughout the northeast USA, are probably important engineers of physical habitat structure in stream ecosystems. Rusty crayfish may also have unexpected, facilitative consequences for other benthic species by reducing fine-sediment accumulation in streams that are sediment impaired. Our study illustrates that biological forces can influence benthic gravel-size distributions and topography and suggests that crayfish may be important drivers of substrate-sorting dynamics and disturbance regimes, with consequences for community structure in streams where they are invasive.},

abstract = {Aquatic food webs are supported by primary production from within the system (autochthony) as well as organic matter produced outside of and transported into the system (allochthony). Zooplankton use allochthonous resources, especially in systems with high terrestrial loading and moderate to low internal primary production. We hypothesized that due to high terrestrial loads and remnant submerged terrestrial material, allochthonous resource use by zooplankton would be significant in all reservoirs and would decline along an increasing reservoir age gradient. Using hydrogen stable isotopes and a Bayesian mixing model, we estimated the contribution of allochthonous sources to organic matter pools and crustaceous zooplankton biomass for ten reservoirs. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in all systems was dominated by allochthonous sources (posterior distribution median {\textgreater}92{\%} allochthonous), while particulate organic matter (POM) composition varied (2–68{\%} allochthonous) and had a lower allochthonous fraction in older reservoirs. There was no relationship between zooplankton allochthony and reservoir age. Crustaceous zooplankton allochthony varied among systems from 26 to 94{\%}, and Chaoborus allochthony, measured in four reservoirs, was similarly variable (33–94{\%}). Consumer allochthony was higher than POM allochthony in some reservoirs, potentially due to terrestrial DOM pathways being important and/or algal resources being inedible (e.g., cyanobacteria). As with many lakes, in the reservoirs we studied, allochthonous inputs account for a significant fraction of the organic matter of basal consumers.},

abstract = {An increasing number of studies have emphasized the need to bridge the disciplines of ecology and geomorphology. A large number of case studies show that organisms can affect erosion, but a comprehensive understanding of biological impacts on sediment transport conditions is still lacking. We use meta-analysis to synthesize published data to quantify the effects of the abundance, body size, and behavior of organisms on erosion in streams. We also explore the influence of current velocity, discharge, and sediment grain size on the strength of biotic effects on erosion. We found that species that both increase erosion (destabilizers) and decrease erosion (stabilizers) can alter incipient sediment motion, sediment suspension, and sediment deposition above control conditions in which the organisms were not present. When abundance was directly manipulated, these biotic effects were consistently stronger in the higher abundance treatment, increasing effect sizes by 66{\%}. Per capita effect size and per capita biomass were also consistently positively correlated. Fish and crustaceans were the most studied organisms, but aquatic insects increased the effect size by 550? compared to other types of organisms after accounting for biomass. In streams with lower discharge and smaller grain sizes, we consistently found stronger biotic effects. Taken collectively, these findings provide synthetic evidence that biology can affect physical processes in streams, and these effects can be mediated by hydraulic energy. We suggest that future studies focus on understudied organisms, such as biofilms, conducting experiments under realistic field conditions, and developing hypotheses for the effect of biology on erosion and velocity currents in the context of restoration to better understand the forces that mediate physical disturbances in stream ecosystems.},

We draw the lessons from both practical experience in diverse contexts around the world and from scholarly advances in understanding the relationships between science and society. Many of these lessons will be familiar to those with experience in crafting knowledge to support action for sustainable development. However, few are included in the formal training of researchers. As a result, when scientists and engineers first venture out of the laboratory or library with the goal of linking their knowledge with action, the outcome has often been ineffectiveness and disillusionment. We therefore articulate here a core set of lessons that we believe should become part of the basic training for researchers interested in crafting usable knowledge for sustainable development. These lessons entail at least four things researchers should know, and four things they should do. The knowing lessons involve understanding the coproduction relationships through which knowledge making and decision making shape one another in social–environmental systems. We highlight the lessons that emerge from examining those coproduction relationships through the ICAP lens, viewing them from the perspectives of Innovation systems, Complex systems, Adaptive systems, and Political systems. The doing lessons involve improving the capacity of the research community to put its understanding of coproduction into practice.

abstract = {There are tens of thousands of small dams in the United States; many of these aging structures are deteriorating. Governments and dam owners face decisions regarding repair or removal of these structures. Along with the many benefits society derives from dams and their impoundments, numerous recent ecological studies are revealing the extensive alteration and degradation of river ecosystems by dams. Dam removal—a principal restoration strategy—is an infrequent event. The major reasons for removal have been public safety and the high costs associated with repair; the goal of river ecosystem restoration now warrants greater attention. Substantial study is being given to the environmental aspects of dams and dam removals, but very little attention has been given to the socioeconomic and institutional dimensions associated with the removal of dams, although these factors play a significant role in the removal decision- making process. Based on a case study of dam removals in Wisconsin—where more than 30 of the state's 3600 small dams have been removed in the past few decades—legal, financial, and socioeconomic issues associated with dam removal are documented and assessed. Dam removal has been complex and contentious, with limited community- based support for removal and loss of the impounded waters. In cases examined here, the estimated costs of repairing a dam averaged more than three times the cost of removal. The availability of governmental financing has been a key determinant in removal decisions.Watershed-scale ecological considerations are not major factors for most local interests. As watershed management and restoration increasingly include dam removal options as part of an integrated strategy, more attention will need to be focused on socioeconomic factors and stakeholder perspectives—variables that strongly influence the viability of this management alternative.},

abstract = {Since the launch of the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River, a distinctive reservoir fluctuation zone has been created and significantly modified by regular dam operations. Sediment redistribution within this artificial landscape differs substantially from that in natural fluvial riparian zones, due to a specific hydrological regime comprising steps of water impoundment with increasing magnitudes and seasonal water level fluctuation holding a range of sediment fluxes. This study reinterpreted post-dam sedimentary dynamics in the reservoir fluctuation zone by stratigraphy determination of a 345-cm long sediment core, and related it to impact of the hydrological regime. Seasonality in absolute grain-size composition of suspended sediment was applied as a methodological basis for stratigraphic differentiation. Sedimentary laminations with relatively higher proportions of sandy fractions were ascribed to sedimentation during the dry season when proximal subsurface bank erosion dominates source contributions, while stratigraphy with a lower proportion of sandy fractions is possibly contributed by sedimentation during the wet season when distal upstream surface erosion prevails. Chronology determination revealed non-linear and high annual sedimentation rates ranging from 21.7 to 152.1. cm/yr. Although channel geomorphology may primarily determine the spatial extent of sedimentation, seasonal sedimentary dynamics was predominantly governed by the frequency, magnitude, and duration of flooding. Summer inundation by natural floods with enhanced sediment loads produced from upstream basins induced higher sedimentation rates than water impoundment during the dry season when distal sediment supply was limited. We thus conclude that flow regulation manipulates contemporary seasonal sedimentary dynamics in the reservoir fluctuation zone, though little impact on total sediment retention rate was detected. Ongoing reductions in flow and sediment supply under human disturbance may have profound implications in affecting sedimentary equilibrium in the reservoir fluctuation zone. The results herein provide insights of how big dams have disrupted the sediment conveyance processes of large scale fluvial systems.},

abstract = {Dam removal has proven to be an effective mechanism for quickly restoring in-stream habitat and returning stream systems to a free flowing state in a wide range of settings. Identification of dam removal projects can be a tedious task that often accounts for multiple social, ecological and hydrologic criteria. Here, a GIS based approach for prioritizing dams for removal based on eco-hydrologic and social metrics is presented. The tool uses a hierarchical decision-support framework to rank dams for removal based on criteria such as good habitat and water quality connectivity, larger streamflow at the dam, improved dam safety and longer stream mile connectivity. The tool is applied for three commonly considered prioritization scenarios that rank dams based on their suitability for removal using: ecological criteria, both social and ecological criteria together, and habitability of anadromous fish criteria. Results show that highest ranking dams from an ecological prioritization are located on reaches of high habitat quality and longer connected river miles. In contrast, social plus ecological prioritization yields higher ranks to dams that are primarily used for recreation, but are also in areas of high habitat quality. Dams in close proximity to anadromous fish spawning areas with high river mileage and few downstream dams are ranked higher by anadromous fish prioritization. Notably, some dams rank high in all criteria. These dams should be paid particular attention to, as they could potentially provide the best benefit if removal is possible. The top 20 ranked dams, as predicted by the tool, includes dams that had been pre-identified by resource managers as potential dam removal projects, indicating that the tool is performing as intended. The tool and presented results should be used as a screening tool in conjunction with the expert knowledge of resource managers to further investigate the influence of site-specific factors, thereby determining the final priority of projects. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {/ Fish and macroinvertebrate assemblage composition, instream habitat features and surrounding land use were assessed in an agriculturally developed watershed to relate overall biotic condition to patterns of land use and channel structure. Six 100-m reaches were sampled on each of three first-order warm-water tributaries of the River Raisin in southeastern Michigan. Comparisons among sites and tributaries showed considerable variability in fish assemblages measured with the index of biotic integrity, macroinvertebrate assemblages characterized with several diversity indexes, and both quantitative and qualitative measurements of instream habitat structure. Land use immediate to the tributaries predicted biotic condition better than regional land use, but was less important than local habitat variables in explaining the variability observed in fish and macroinvertebrate assemblages. Fish and macroinvertebrates appeared to respond differently to landscape configuration and habitat variables as well. Fish showed a stronger relationship to flow variability and immediate land use, while macroinvertebrates correlated most strongly with dominant substrate. Although significant, the relationships between instream habitat variables and immediate land use explained only a modest amount of the variability observed. A prior study of this watershed ascribed greater predictive power to land use. In comparison to our study design, this study covered a larger area, providing greater contrast among subcatchments. Differences in outcomes suggests that the scale of investigation influences the strength of predictive variables. Thus, we concluded that the importance of local habitat conditions is best revealed by comparisons at the within-subcatchment scale.

abstract = {System coupling and landscape connectivity control the flow of water and sediment through landscapes. Although coupling is well known to control long-term landscape development and shorter-term sensitivity to disturbance, the anthropogenic influences on coupling are seldom considered in hydrologic investigations. In particular, the building of small-scale water diversion (earth banks) and collection (farm dams) infrastructure on hillslopes in dryland agricultural areas may significantly alter hillslope-channel coupling. Twelve sub-catchment basins in a dryland agricultural region were investigated under their natural (ignoring infrastructure) and modified (including infrastructure) conditions to investigate the influence of water collection infrastructure on hydrologic connectivity, and whether manual modification of a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) could account for the impact of these factors in hydrologic simulation of hydrologic and geomorphic processes. Dam numbers and density have both increased over the period of available aerial photography (1965-1999), resulting in an average 39.5{\%} reduction (range 4.3-86.7{\%}) in the area retaining hydrologic connectivity with the basin outlet. Analysis of basins dominated by either banks or dams, and with combinations of both was performed using the Cumulative Area Distribution (CAD), Hypsometric Curve (HC), Simplified Width Function (SWF) and Instantaneous Unit Hydrograph (IUH). The geomorphic descriptors (CAD and HC) showed little change in basin structure as a result of farm dam and bank construction, but hydrologic descriptors (SWF and IUH) indicate that hillslope processes are significantly altered by farm dams and banks. Because runoff models are sensitive to catchment area, incorporating hillslope water capture and diversion infrastructure into the base data sets may offer a solution to improved parameterisation of spatial models of hydrology, particularly in dryland agricultural regions. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Urbanization, climate, and ecosystem change represent major challenges for managing water resources. Although water systems are complex, a need exists for a generalized representation of these systems to identify important components and linkages to guide scientific inquiry and aid water management. We developed an integrated Structure-Actor-Water framework (iSAW) to facilitate the understanding of and transitions to sustainable water systems. Our goal was to produce an interdisciplinary framework for water resources research that could address management challenges across scales (e.g., plot to region) and domains (e.g., water supply and quality, transitioning, and urban landscapes). The framework was designed to be generalizable across all human–environment systems, yet with sufficient detail and flexibility to be customized to specific cases. iSAW includes three major components: structure (natural, built, and social), actors (individual and organizational), and water (quality and quantity). Key linkages among these components include: (1) ecological/hydrologic processes, (2) ecosystem/geomorphic feedbacks, (3) planning, design, and policy, (4) perceptions, information, and experience, (5) resource access and risk, and (6) operational water use and management. We illustrate the flexibility and utility of the iSAW framework by applying it to two research and management problems: understanding urban water supply and demand in a changing climate and expanding use of green storm water infrastructure in a semi-arid environment. The applications demonstrate that a generalized conceptual model can identify important components and linkages in complex and diverse water systems and facilitate communication about those systems among researchers from diverse disciplines.},

abstract = {Regional-scale restoration is a tool of growing importance in environmental management, and the number, scope, and complexity of restoration programs is increasing. Although the importance of natural science to the success of such projects generally is recognized, the actual use of natural science in these programs rarely has been evaluated. We used techniques of program evaluation to examine the use of natural science in six American and three Western European regional-scale restoration programs. Our results suggest that ensuring the technical rigor and directed application of the science is important to program development and delivery. However, the influence of science may be constrained if strategies for its integration into the broader program are lacking. Consequently, the influence of natural science in restoration programs is greatest when formal mechanisms exist for incorporating science into programs, for example, via a framework for integration of science and policy. Our evaluation proposes a model that can be used to enhance the influence of natural science in regional-scale restoration programs in the United States and elsewhere.},

abstract = {Allocating water to different uses implies trading off the benefits perceived by different sectors. This paper demonstrates how visualising the trade-offs implied by the best performing water management options helps balance water use benefits and find sustainable solutions. The approach consists of linking a water resources model that can simulate many management policies and track diverse measures of system performance, to a many-objective evolutionary optimisation algorithm. This generates the set of Pareto-optimal management alternatives for several simultaneous objectives. The relative performance of these efficient management alternatives is then visualised as trade-off curves or surfaces using visual analytic plots. Visually assessing trade-offs between benefits helps select policies that achieve a decision-maker-selected balance between different metrics of system performance. We apply this approach to a multi-reservoir water resource system in Brazil's semi-arid Jaguaribe basin where current water allocation procedures favour sectors with greater political power and technical knowledge. The case study identifies promising reservoir operating policies by exploring trade-offs between economic, ecological and livelihood benefits as well as traditional hydropower generation, irrigation and water supply. Results show optimised policies can increase allocations to downstream uses while increasing median land availability for the poorest farmers by 25{\%}. ?? 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {In addition to technical and economical reasons, environmental impacts are becoming an increasingly important issue in the policy making of hydropower development. According to different spatial scales, environmental impacts of hydropower projects can be divided into environmental impacts around a plant and environmental impacts downstream. The former can be transformed into a uniformed quantification based on CO2 equivalent (CO2-e), while the latter can be quantified in terms of reduced downstream flow. Environmental constraints around a plant are presented as the minimum production of environmental impacts around a plant, while those downstream are presented as not affecting the downstream environmental flow requirements. Based on five large hydropower projects (LHPs) and 10 small hydropower projects (SHPs) cases in Tibet, China, LHPs have greater environmental impacts around a plant when compared with SHP, but the opposite is true for downstream environmental impacts. For environmental constraints around a plant and downstream, the environmentally feasible potential for hydropower development on the Lhasa River is 398.3MW, which accounts for 15.6{\%} of its theoretical potential, while the optimized hydropower mode choice is 285.7MW for LHP and 112.6MW for SHP. Environmentally feasible potential aims to balance hydropower generation with environmental protection, and tends to maximize the low carbon attributes of hydropower. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Naugatuck River and its tributaries once supported abundant anadromous fish runs. These runs ceased during the industrial revolution due to the construction of numerous run-of-the-river dams and poor water quality. Recent and anticipated water quality improvements now justify a parallel effort to restore anadromous fish runs to the Naugatuck River basin. This watershed-wide restoration project focuses on fish passage at eight obsolete industrial dams on the Naugatuck and Mad Rivers, ranging in height from 1.2 to 6 meters. Multiple fish passage alternatives were considered prior to recommending that four of the eight dams be fully or partially removed, an instream by-pass channel, rock ramp fishway and a fish ladder will be constructed around three others. The final dam is still under study and it is anticipated that dam removal will be recommended. To date, four dams have been removed. This paper will focus on the fish passage alternative analysis prepared for this project and the issues that arose during design and construction of the first four dam removals.
