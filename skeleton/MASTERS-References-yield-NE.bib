abstract = {Both human activity and climate change can influence erosion rates and initiate rapid landscape change. Understanding the relative impact of these factors is critical to managing the risks of extreme erosion related to flooding and landslide occurrence. Here we present a 2100 year record of sediment mass accumulation and inferred erosion based on lacustrine sediment cores from Amherst Lake, Vermont, USA. Using deposition from August 2011 Tropical Storm Irene as a modern analogue, we identified distinct event deposits indicative of destructive erosion events. These deposits record a prolonged (multidecadal) interval of enhanced erosion following the initial storm-induced landscape disturbance. The direct impact of human land cover alteration is minimal in comparison to the more recent twentieth century increase in the occurrence of catastrophic erosion linked to overall wetter conditions that favor high erosion rates and more easily trigger landslides during periods of extreme precipitation.

abstract = {Discharge and annual bedload measurements from the 1.25 km2 South Branch of Birch Brook, NW Massachusetts, show that the annual flux of bedload was 2.0 tons km-2 yr-1 from this forested basin between 1986 and 2000. Sediment transport by the South Branch is controlled by discharge events above bankfull (0.34 m3 s-1) and the relative availability of sediment in the stream channel, particularly material stored by organic debris dams. Peak discharge events explain 91{\%} of the variance in measured sediment discharge on the South Branch during the period 1986 to 1996. After 1996, however, correlation is poor, reflecting a change in sediment availability after sediment year 1996, when sediment flux was 5 times average values. Analyzing the sediment budget for the Birch Brook catchment permits us to speculate about how deforestation, grazing and cultivation in the 19th century affected hillslope erosion and stream sediment load. Higher sediment loads during the past century may have produced the low terraces that line the lower reaches of Birch Brook. The present rate of sediment transport from the Birch Brook catchment suggests that the erosion rate from forested catchments in NW Massachusetts is low.},

abstract = {Landscape form represents the cumulative effects of de-stabilizing events relative to recovery processes. Most geomorphic research has focused on the role of episodic rare events on landscape form with less attention paid to the role and persistence of chronic inputs. To better establish the interplay between chronic and episodic extreme events at regional scales, we used aerial photography and post-flood sediment sampling to assess stream and hillslope response and recovery to a 100-300yr. flood caused by Tropical Storm Irene in New England. Within a 14 000km super(2) study area, analysis of aerial photographs indicated that the storm initiated (n=534) and reactivated (n=460) a large number of landslides. These landslides dramatically increased overall estimates of regional erosion rates (from 0.0023mm/yr. without Irene to 0.0072mm/yr. with Irene). Similarly, Irene-generated LWD inputs of 0.25-0.5 trees/km exceeded annual background rates in a single event, and these concentrated inputs (10 super(1)-10 super(2) of trees/landslide) are likely to result in large jams and snags that are particularly persistent and geomorphically effective. Finally, we found that landslide scars continue to provide elevated sediment inputs years after the event, as evidenced by sustained higher suspended sediment concentrations in streams with Irene-generated landslides. Overall, our results indicate that infrequent, high-magnitude events have a more important geomorphic role in tectonically stable, more moderate-relief systems than has been previously recognized. Understanding the role of these events has particular relevance in regions such as New England, where the frequency and magnitude of extreme storms is expected to increase. Further, these effects may force reconsideration of conservation and restoration targets (for example in channel form and large wood loading and distribution) in fluvial systems.},

abstract = {Suspended-sediment concentrations, dis- charges, loads, and yields were determined for eight subbasins in the Housatonic River Basin in western Massachusetts, eastern New York, and northwestern Connecticut from April 1994 through March 1996. Suspended-sediment samples were collected at three continuous-record sediment stations and at four partial-record sediment stations. Suspended-sediment concentrations in samples collected during the period of study ranged from less than 0.5 to 3,400 milligrams per liter, and concurrent streamflows ranged from 0.03 to 126 cubic feet per second per square mile at the seven sta- tions. Median suspended-sediment concentrations in samples collected at each station ranged from 7 to 61 milligrams per liter. Median streamflows during suspended-sediment sampling ranged from 1.86 to 5.88 cubic feet per second per square mile. Instantaneous suspended-sediment yields ranged from less than 0.005 to 185 tons per day per square mile, and medians ranged from 0.03 to 1.12 tons per day per square mile at the seven stations. Total suspended-sediment loads (mass) from April 1994 through March 1996 at the continuous-record sediment stations were 11,603 tons at Housatonic River near Great Barrington, 7,929 tons at Green River, and 54,347 tons at Housatonic River near Ashley Falls. Suspended-sediment load during January 1996 at the Green River station accounted for about 54 percent of the total suspended-sediment load for the Green River during the 2-year study. Suspended-sediment load on January 19 and 20, 1996, at the Green River station accounted for about 50 percent of the January 1996 suspended- sediment load, or about 27 percent of the total suspended-sediment load during the 2-year study. This large suspended-sediment transport was the result of rainfall and snowmelt on January 19 and 20, 1996—the equivalent of a 5- to 6-inch rain storm in the Green River subbasin. Total suspended-sediment loads during the 2-year study at the partial-record sediment stations were 3,052 tons at Williams River, 1,758 tons at Ironworks Brook, and 17,927 tons at Konkapot River. Suspended-sediment yields from April 1994 through March 1996 at the continuous- record sediment stations were 21 (tons/yr)/mi2 at Housatonic River near Great Barrington, 78 (tons/yr)/mi2 at Green River, and 58 (tons/yr)/mi2 at Housatonic River near Ashley Falls. Suspended-sediment yields during the 2- year study at the partial-record sediment stations were 35 (tons/yr)/mi2 at Williams River, 78 (tons/yr)/mi2 at Ironworks Brook, and 147 (tons/yr)/mi2 at Konkapot River. Suspended- sediment yields were estimated for two subbasins in the Housatonic River Basin—Schenob Brook at Sheffield, a partial-record sediment station, and the area adjacent to the Housatonic River between Great Barrington and Ashley Falls. The estimate of suspended-sediment yield at Schenob Brook at Sheffield of 82 (tons/yr)/mi2 is comparable to the yield determined for the Green River and Ironworks Brook. The estimate of suspended- sediment yield for the area adjacent to the Housatonic River between Great Barrington and Ashley Falls was 395 (tons/yr)/mi2. This estimated suspended-sediment yield was 2.7 to 18.8 times greater than that estimated for any of the other subbasins. Several basin and land-use characteristics thought to affect suspended-sediment transport in the subbasins were compared to the suspended- sediment yields. The characteristics that seemed to affect suspended-sediment discharge were dams, which contributes to decreased yields; Hadley, Limerick, Linlithgo, Saco, and Winooski silt loam soils (high erodibility soils), which contributes to increased yields; stratified-drift deposits, which contributes to increased yields; and agricultural and open land, which contributes to increased yields. The effect of stratified-drift deposits on suspended-sediment discharge is thought to be greater when those deposits are of glaciolacustrine (generally clay, silt, and fine sand), rather than glaciofluvial (clay, silt, sand, gravel, and cobbles) origin. The silt loam soils, glaciolacustrine deposits, and agricultural and open land are interrelated, inasmuch as the silt loam soils generally are associated with glaciolacustrine deposits and agricultural activities.},

abstract = {Mountain regions throughout the world face intense development pressures associated with recreational and tourism uses. Despite these pressures, much of the research on bio-geophysical impacts of humans in mountain regions has focused on the effects of natural resource extraction. This paper describes findings from the first 3 years of a study examining high elevation watershed processes in a region undergoing alpine resort development. Our study is designed as a paired-watershed experiment. The Ranch Brook watershed (9{\textperiodcentered}6 km2) is a relatively pristine, forested watershed and serves as the undeveloped ‘control' basin. West Branch (11{\textperiodcentered}7 km2) encompasses an existing alpine ski resort, with approximately 17{\%} of the basin occupied by ski trails and impervious surfaces, and an additional 7{\%} slated for clearing and development. Here, we report results for water years 2001–2003 of streamflow and water quality dynamics for these watersheds. Precipitation increases significantly with elevation in the watersheds, and winter precipitation represents 36–46{\%} of annual precipitation. Artificial snowmaking from water within West Branch watershed currently augments annual precipitation by only 3–4{\%}. Water yield in the developed basin exceeded that in the control by 18–36{\%}. Suspended sediment yield was more than two and a half times greater and fluxes of all major solutes were higher in the developed basin. Our study is the first to document the effects of existing ski area development on hydrology and water quality in the northeastern US and will serve as an important baseline for evaluating the effects of planned resort expansion activities in this area.

abstract = {Little is known about rates and patterns of Holocene hillslope erosion in areas once covered by Pleistocene ice sheets and now heavily populated. Yet, understanding past landscape behavior is prerequisite to predicting and mitigating future impacts of human-induced disturbance and climate change. Using northern Vermont as an example, we demonstrate that the sedimentary record preserved in humid-region ponds and alluvial fans can be dated, deciphered isotopically and stratigraphically, and used to understand the history of hillslope erosion. Our data suggest that erosion rates were higher in the early and late Holocene than in the mid-Holocene, perhaps the result of changing climate and the frequency of severe storms. In Vermont, dated alluvial fan sediments reveal that the highest rates of hillslope erosion occurred as a consequence of European settlement. The geologic record of colonial deforestation is clear, revealing significant human impact and suggesting that past landscape response is a meaningul basis for guiding future land management practices.},

@article{Davis1982c,
abstract = {Analyses of multiple sediment cores from Mirror Lake, New Hampshire, dated by 14C and pollen, show that between 14,000 and 11,000 B.P. silts and sands were deposited over 85{\%} of the basin. After 11,000 B.P. organic-rich sediments were focused into the deeper parts of the basin, and no sediment accumulated in water {\textless} 5 m deep. Late-glacial particulate inorganic inputs were 33 times greater than modern losses from forested watersheds at Hubbard Brook. After trees became established, inorganic inputs fell sharply to modern levels. Late-glacial organic inputs were half the average during the last 11,000 yr. At 4 of the sites studied, accumulation rates reached a maximum between 7000 and 4000 B.P. The precise date varies from site, to site, suggesting that it would be misleading to link peak accumulation in a single core to events in the watershed. After 4000 B.P. organic sediment accumulation rates declined at all 4 sites. Parallel declines in accumulation rates of both pollen and inorganic sediments suggest that this decline is due to the process of sediment focusing rather than to a change in decomposition rates or in organic inputs related to autochthonous or allochthonous primary production.},
