abstract = {The post-orogenic evolution of the Laramide landscape of the western U.S. has been characterized by late Cenozoic channel incision of basins and their adjacent ranges. One means of constraining the incision history of basins is dating the remnants of gravel-capped surfaces above modern streams. Here, we focus on an extensive remnant of the Rocky Flats surface between Golden and Boulder, Colorado, and use in situ-produced 10Be and 26Al concentrations in terrace alluvium to constrain the Quaternary history of this surface. Coal and Ralston Creeks, both tributaries of the South Platte River, abandoned the Rocky Flats surface and formed the Verdos and Slocum pediments, which are cut into Cretaceous bedrock between Rocky Flats and the modern stream elevations. Rocky Flats alluvium ranges widely in age, from {\textgreater} 2 Ma to ∼ 400 ka, with oldest ages to the east and younger ages closer to the mountain front. Numerical modeling of isotope concentration depth profiles suggests that individual sites have experienced multiple resurfacing events. Preliminary results indicate that Verdos and Slocum alluvium along Ralston Creek, which is slightly larger than Coal Creek, is several hundred thousand years old. Fluvial incision into these surfaces appears therefore to progress headward in response to downcutting of the South Platte River. The complex ages of these surfaces call into question any correlation of such surfaces based solely on their elevation above the modern channel. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Bierman1994c,
abstract = {The application of in-situ produced cosmogenic isotopes to problems in geomorphology has increased rapidly over the past decade. At least 57 papers and numerous abstracts have been published since the mid-1980s when the first mass-spectrometric measurements of terrestrially produced cosmogenic isotopes were made. Taken at face value, these studies provide quantitative information about rates of landscape evolution and landform age; however, the significance of calculated erosion rates depends strongly on the models used to interpret isotopic data, the validity of assumptions inherent to these models, and the geologic surroundings in which the sample was collected. This paper attempts to place cosmogenic isotope studies in a geomorphic context by reviewing fundamentals of the method and evaluating the validity of assumptions under which these data have been interpreted. At present, the establishment of high-precision, cosmogenically based glacial and alluvial chronologies is stymiedby the evolution of geomorphic surfaces, the erosion of rock from sampled boulders, the potential for isotope inheritance from previous exposure, and the uncertainty of isotopic measurements. Uncertainties in isotope production rates and the observed variability of exposure correlated reliably with those obtained by other techniques. Estimation of erosion rates at single points on the landscape gives useful small-scale information. Extrapolation of these rates over longer time and larger spatial scales is less sure and most likely biased toward lower erosion rates by the inadvertent selection of resistant sample sites. However, because erosion rates are so poorly constrained at present, even estimates to within a factor of 2 may be of significant value to geomorphologists and tectonists.},

@article{Reusser2015c,
abstract = {Establishing background (geologic) rates of erosion is prerequisite to quantifying the impact of human activities on Earth's surface. Here, we present 10 Be estimates of background erosion rates for ten large (10,000–100,000 km2 ) river basins in the southeastern United States, an area that was cleared of native forest and used intensively for agriculture. These 10 Be-based rates are indicative of the pace at which the North American passive-margin landscape eroded before European settlement ({\~{}}8 m/m.y.). Comparing these background rates to both rates of post-settlement hillslope erosion and to river sediment yields for the same basins, we find that following peak disturbance (late 1800s and early 1900s), rates of hillslope erosion ({\~{}}950 m/m.y.) exceeded 10 Be-determined background rates more than one-hundred fold. Although large-basin sediment yields during peak disturbance increased 5–10× above pre-settlement norms, rivers at the time were transporting only {\~{}}6{\%} of the eroded material; work by others suggests that the bulk of historically eroded material remained and still remains as legacy sediment stored at the base of hillslopes and along valley bottoms. Because background ero- sion rates, such as we present here, reflect the rate at which soil is generated over millennial time scales, they can inform and enhance landscape-management strategies.},

@article{Miller2013c,
abstract = {The persistence of topography within ancient orogens remains one of the outstanding questions in landscape evolution. In the eastern North American Appalachians, this question is manifest in the outstanding problem of whether topographic relief is in a quasi-equilibrium state, decaying slowly over many millennia, or whether relief has increased during the late Cenozoic. Here we present quantitative geomorphic data from the nonglaciated portion of the Susquehanna River drainage basin that provide insight into these end-member models. Analysis of channel profiles draining upland catchments in the northern Valley and Ridge, Appalachian Plateau, Blue Ridge, and Piedmont provinces reveals that a large number of streams have well defined knickpoints clustered at 300-600m elevation but not systematically associated with transitions from weak to resistant substrate. Cosmogenic 10Be inventories of modern stream sediment indicate that erosion rates are spatially variable, ranging from {\~{}}5-30m/Myr above knickpoints to {\~{}}50-100m/Myr below knickpoints. Overall, channel gradients, normalized for drainage area, scale linearly with catchment-averaged erosion rates. Collectively, regionally consistent spatial relationships among erosion rate, channel steepness, and knickpoints reveal an ongoing wave of transient channel adjustment to a change in relative base level. Reconstructions of relict channel profiles above knickpoints suggest that higher rates of incision are associated with {\~{}}100-150m of relative base level fall that accompanied epierogenic rock uplift rather than a change to a more erosive climate or drainage reorganization. Channel response timescales imply that the onset of relative base level change predates {\~{}}3.5Ma and may have begun as early as {\~{}}15Ma. We suggest that adjustment of the channel network was likely driven by changes in mantle dynamics along the eastern seaboard of North America during the Neogene. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

@inproceedings{Dethier2002c,
abstract = {Rates of long-term erosion across the Rocky Mountain region help to constrain the relative roles of tectonic uplift, climatic change and rock resistance in sculpting the modern landscape. We measured concentrations of cosmogenic nuclides in quartz extracted from stream sediment from 13 catchments to provide estimates of erosion rates at time scales from103 to 105 yr. Preliminary analysis of 10Be activity from small ({\textless} 50 km2), upland catchments in Colorado and Wyoming indicates that the landscape is lowering at rates between 14 and 250 m/MY in this semiarid area. We sampled basins that: (1) have not been glaciated; (2) have only small volumes of sediment stored beneath terraces and in colluvium, and (3) display minimal evidence for anthropogenic disturbance. We measured the 10Be content of the 250 to 710 mm sand fraction collected in cross-channel transects. Our initial data do not show strong influence of basin relief, average slope, drainage area, tectonic environment, or climate. However, the range of erosion rates from different lithologies suggests that relative rock resistance exerts strong control on landform evolution in the Rocky Mountain region. Catchments draining weathered Precambrian basement (granites and gneisses) typical of the northern Front, Laramie and Medicine Bow Ranges give erosion rates of 18 to 30 (24± 6; n=9) m/MY. Weakly lithified Middle and Upper Cenozoic basin fill is eroding at rates of 45 to 250 m/MY at sites in southern Wyoming and northern Colorado. Precambrian quartzite exposed in the eastern Uinta Mountains gave a rate of 14 m/MY, the lowest we measured. Erosion rates measured in upland granitic and gneissic catchments in Colorado are comparable to those measured in other non-orogenic areas such as the southern Appalachians. If our initial measurements for erosion rates of weakly lithified basin fill are typical, most of the middle and late Cenozoic fill in the greater Wyoming area could have been stripped in the past 5 to 10 million years.},

abstract = {For more than a century, geologists have sought to measure the distribution of erosion rates on Earth's dynamic surface. Since the mid-1980s, measurements of in situ 10Be, a cosmogenic radionuclide, have been used to estimate outcrop and basin-scale erosion rates at 87 sites around the world. Here, we compile, normalize, and compare published 10Be erosion rate data (n = 1599) in order to understand how, on a global scale, geologic erosion rates integrated over 103 to 106 years vary between climate zones, tectonic settings, and different rock types. Drainage basins erode more quickly (mean = 218 m Myr−1; median = 54 m Myr−1) than outcrops (mean = 12 m Myr−1; median = 5.4 m Myr−1), likely reflecting the acceleration of rock weathering rates under soil. Drainage basin and outcrop erosion rates both vary by climate zone, rock type, and tectonic setting. On the global scale, environmental parameters (latitude, elevation, relief, mean annual precipitation and temperature, seismicity, basin slope and area, and percent basin cover by vegetation) explain erosion rate variation better when they are combined in multiple regression analyses than when considered in bivariate relationships. Drainage basin erosion rates are explained well by considering these environmental parameters (R2 = 0.60); mean basin slope is the most powerful regressor. Outcrop erosion rates are less well explained (R2 = 0.32), and no one parameter dominates. The variance of erosion rates is better explained when subpopulations of the global data are analyzed. While our compilation is global, the grouped spatial distribution of cosmogenic studies introduces a bias that will only be addressed by research in under-sampled regions.},

abstract = {Land use changes, such as deforestation and agricultural expansion, increase soil erosion on the scale of hillslopes and small drainage basins. However, the effects of these changes on the sediment load in rivers is poorly quantified, with a few studies scattered globally, and only 10 data points in the world's most populous nation, China. At 20 different sites in western China, we compare contemporary fluvial sediment yield data collected daily over 4 to 26 years between 1945 and 1987 (median=19years) to long-term measures of sediment generation based on new isotopic measurements of in situ 10Be in river sediments. We find that median sediment yield at these sites exceeds background sediment generation rates by a factor of two (from 0.13 to 5.79 times, median 1.85 times) and that contemporary sediment yield is statistically significantly different from long-term sediment generation rates (p {\textless}0.05). Agricultural land use is directly and significantly proportional to the ratio of contemporary sediment yield to long term sediment generation rates (Spearman correlation coefficient rho=0.52, p{\textless}0.05). We support these findings by calculating erosion indices (following Brown et al., 1988), which compare the delivery of meteoric 10Be to each watershed with the export of meteoric 10Be bound to riverine sediment. Erosion indices are also directly and significantly proportional to agricultural land use (rho=0.58, p{\textless}0.05). Together, these data sets suggest that upstream agricultural land use has significantly increased sediment supply to rivers in western China, likely increasing turbidity and decreasing ecosystem services such as fisheries.},

@article{Ouimet2015c,
abstract = {Atmospherically-derived cosmogenic nuclides such as meteoric 10Be offer great potential in Quaternary science because they can be used as landform geochronometers and as sediment tracers. Use of meteoric 10Be inventories for determining landform age, soil residence time, or erosion rates requires knowing the long-term rate of deposition for this cosmogenic nuclide to the Earth's surface. Here, we present meteoric 10Be inventories measured at 6 dated sites near the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory, Front Range, Colorado. Each site lies on a relatively stable landform (broad moraine or fluvial terrace) at slopes between {\textless}1 and 7° and supports well-developed soil horizons. Time-averaged rates of total meteoric 10Be deposition (precipitation, dryfall, and dust deposition) calculated from measured inventories at these sites range from 0.4 to 5.0×106atomscm-2yr-1; none of the inventories match expected primary meteoric 10Be deposition rates that global, latitude-based models or precipitation-specific models predict for this region. Meteoric 10Be inventories and calculated deposition rates at the three older ({\textgreater}90ka) sites fall below (0.3-0.7×) model predictions; inventories and rates at the three Pinedale-age sites (LGM; 21-15ka) are higher (1.5-4×) than model predictions. Previous analysis of soils in the Front Range over the same timeframe as these sites indicate that long-term dust accumulation rates are low and associated secondary meteoric 10Be deposition is unlikely to account for the deviation from model predictions. At the Pinedale-age sites in particular, long-term dustfall would have to be 1-2 orders of magnitude higher to add the meteoric 10Be required to account for measured inventories. Low inventories at older sites are consistent with loss of meteoric 10Be through physical erosion or selective removal of near-surface soil enriched in meteoric 10Be; time-averaged rates of total meteoric 10Be deposition for these sites are minima. We speculate that higher inventories at Pinedale-age sites reflect the addition of meteoric 10Be due to snowdrifts and/or interflow associated with landform location, increasing the effective precipitation-related primary meteoric 10Be deposition at the sampled sites. Given these constraints, and the spatial variation observed around the Front Range, we suggest that 1.5±0.2×106atomscm-2yr-1 is an appropriate long-term meteoric 10Be deposition rate to use across much of the Front Range region that receives 45-55cm of precipitation a year. This long-term total meteoric 10Be deposition rate is {\~{}}30-50{\%} higher than that predicted by global or annual precipitation-specific models, emphasizing that local calibration of deposition rates is essential for geomorphic studies around the globe.},

abstract = {Humans, with their tools, brains, and expanding populations have been changing the Earth for millennia – moving soil, cutting trees, damming rivers, and altering the atmosphere. With the advent of fossil fuels, the rate at which people could change the Earth increased dramatically. Critical to understanding the magnitude of human impact and thus to determining what mitigation strategies might make the most sense and be most effective requires data – not only on the magnitude of human impact today but on background rates of change in the past. Cosmogenic nuclides, including Be-10, C-14, and Al-26 can be useful monitors of millennial scale rates of change that help place human impact in the proper geologic context. This talk provides several examples of how cosmogenic nuclides can help contextualize rates of change during the Anthropocene. Since the 1990s, measurements of cosmogenic nuclides in river sediment have been used to compare contemporary rates of sediment export with background rates of sediment generation - important data for understanding the global flux of sediment and sediment-associated nutrients to deltas and the world's oceans as well as estimating the filling rates of reservoirs. Where Anthropocene rates of sediment export have been measured, they typically exceed geologic rates of sediment generation by several times. Global compilations and many regional studies show average basin slope is a reasonable proxy for long-term erosion rates providing a simple, calibrated means to estimate rates needed to establish regulatory limits for sediment when it is considered a pollutant. Since the 1980s, a variety of different nuclides have been used to determine the history of now-vanished glaciers and ice sheets mostly by dating moraines. Recently, in light of rapid, human-induced climate change, cosmogenic nuclides have been used to understand better the sensitivity of ice sheets to past periods of warmth. Measurements of Be-10 and Al-26 in marine sediment cores, ice-bound cobbles, and rock recovered from under ice have been used to argue both for and against the long-term stability of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets. Such data, once we are better able to interpret it, could well allow us to see into the past and determine how Earth's ice sheets responded to past periods of exceptional warmth – our likely future.},

abstract = {Cosmogenic Al-26, Be-10. and C-14 dating of fluvial fill terraces in steep canyons of the Colorado Front Range provides a temporal framework for analysing episodic aggradation and incision. Results from Boulder Canyon show that terrace heights above the modern channel (grade) can be divided into: (1) Bull Lake (greater than or similar to100 ka; 20-15 m above grade); (2) Pinedale (32-10 ka; 15-4 m above grade); and (3) Holocene age ({\textless}4 to above grade). No pre-Bull Lake deposits are preserved along Boulder Canyon, and only three small remnants {\textgreater} 15 to above grade record Bull Lake deposition. Well-preserved terraces of Pinedale age suggest that the range of terrace height above grade reflects short-term fluctuations in the river profile during periods of rapidly changing stream load and power. Net river incision apparently occurred during transitions to interglacial periods. Soil development and stratigraphic position, along with limited cosmogenic and C-14 dating, suggest that similar to 130 ka terraces in Boulder Canyon correlate with the Louviers Alluvium, and that 32 to 10 ka fills in the canyon correlate with the Broadway Alluvium on the adjacent High Plains. Late Pleistocene incision rates (similar to0.15 m ka(-1)) along Boulder Canyon exceed pre-late Pleistocene incision rates, and are higher than middle to late Pleistocene incision rates (similar to0.04 m ka(-1)) on the High Plains.
