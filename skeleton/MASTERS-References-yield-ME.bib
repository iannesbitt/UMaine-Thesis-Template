abstract = {Gould Pond sediments are unusual in North America in that they include a continuous record of change from marine to freshwater conditions during the late-glacial period, with a wide array of micro- and macrofossils deposited during a period of high sedimentation rate. Marine waters, much colder than those in the present Gulf of Maine, covered the site at the time of deglaciation (c. 13,200 BP). Plants characteristic of modem tundra grew on nearby uplands. Marine recession, due to isostatic rebound of the land, occurred from c. 12,800-12,200 BP. The lake water was completely freshened by 12,000 BP. A sparse shrub-herb tundra became established around Gould Pond as marine waters receded. Subsequent to 11,300 BP, sedges and other herbs became more abundant, and willow and Dryas less abundant, signifying increased warmth and decreased frost action. At least six tree species, all now common in the area, arrived around Gould Pond between c. 10,800 and 10,500 BP. This rapid transition was coincident with the most rapid major non-anthropogenic change of vegetation at sites across eastern North America during the postglacial period.},

abstract = {A palaeohydrological study of Mansell Pond, a small (4 ha), closed-basin lake in central Maine, revealed distinct changes in lake levels throughout the Holocene. We examined the texture, organic content and macrofossils of eight cores and obtained 29 radiocarbon dates on transitions between sedimentary units. The water level fell between about 8000 14 C yr {\{}BP{\}} and 6000 14 C yr {\{}BP{\}}, and remained low until after 5000 14 C yr {\{}BP.{\}} The water level may have begun rising as early as 4750 14 C yr {\{}BP{\}}, with the most rapid increase occurring from 3225 14 C yr {\{}BP{\}} to 2780 14 C yr {\{}BP.{\}} This interpretation varies at some points from an earlier assessment of Mansell Pond's Holocene lake levels that was based on pollen and charcoal evidence from a single core. Records of Holocene lake levels from eastern Canada, the Lake Ontario region and southern New England are inconsistent with each other, suggesting that the influence of dominant air masses has been highly localized in this region},
