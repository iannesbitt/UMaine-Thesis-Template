abstract = {Phosphorus (P) may be liberated from lake sediments by reductive dissolution of Fe(OH)3(S) during periods of hypolimnetic anoxia. P, however, remains adsorbed to Al(OH)3(S) regardless of redox conditions. During chronic or episodic acidification of a catchment, ionic Al is mobilized from soils to receiving waters. A fraction of the mobilized Al may precipitate as a consequence of higher pH of the receiving waters. We hypothesized that phosphorus retention in lake sediments is directly related to the magnitude of Al loading in response to low pH in the watershed. We studied cores representing over 200 years of sediment accumulation in historically acidic Mud Pond and Little Long Pond in eastern Maine, USA. Sequential chemical extractions of sediment were used to assess the history of Al, Fe, and P interactions. Mud Pond is a first-order pond with a pH of {\~{}} 4.7, having acidified slightly in response to anthropogenic acidification from {\~{}} 1930. The inlet stream to Mud Pond has dissolved Al concentrations often exceeding 500 $\mu$g/L, of which more than half is organically-bound. Mud Pond drains into Little Long Pond, a second-order pond with a historical pH of {\textless} 6, and which has shown little pH or alkalinity response to increases or decreases in atmospheric SO42- input. Sequential extractions show that Al and P are predominantly in the 0.1 M NaOH-extractable fraction in the sediments from both ponds throughout the cores. The concentration of the likely biogenic and non-reactive P within the NaOH fraction increases up core from {\textless} 30{\%} to {\~{}} 60{\%}. Extractable Fe ({\textless} 20{\%} of extractable Al) is mainly in the 0.1 M NaOH-extractable fraction, except for the top few cm, which are predominantly in the bicarbonate-dithionite reducible fraction. Accumulation rates of sediment, Al, Fe, and P in both ponds have increased in the last 50-60 yr, but fractions remain in the same proportion. Throughout both sediment cores the molar ratio of specific Al:P fractions greatly exceeds 25, and molar ratio of specific Al:Fe fractions greatly exceeds 3, the thresholds proposed by Kop{\'{a}}{\v{c}}ek et al. [Kop{\'{a}}{\v{c}}ek J, Borovec J, Hejzlar J, Ulrich K-U, Norton SA, Amirbahman A. Aluminum control of phosphorus sorption by lake sediments. Environ Sci Technol 2005; 39: 8784-89.] for P release during anoxia. The data illustrate a continuous association of P with Al in both ponds during the last two centuries, likely due to the persistent natural acidity of the catchments. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We analyzed gross sediment structure, organic and carbonate content, mineral grain size, and macrofossils of six cores from each of the two lakes, and obtained 72 radiocarbon dates. Interpretation of this paleo-environmental data suggests that the lateglacial and Younger Dryas climate was dry, and lake levels were low.

@article{Anderson1992b,
abstract = {Gould Pond sediments are unusual in North America in that they include a continuous record of change from marine to freshwater conditions during the late-glacial period, with a wide array of micro- and macrofossils deposited during a period of high sedimentation rate. Marine waters, much colder than those in the present Gulf of Maine, covered the site at the time of deglaciation (c. 13,200 BP). Plants characteristic of modem tundra grew on nearby uplands. Marine recession, due to isostatic rebound of the land, occurred from c. 12,800-12,200 BP. The lake water was completely freshened by 12,000 BP. A sparse shrub-herb tundra became established around Gould Pond as marine waters receded. Subsequent to 11,300 BP, sedges and other herbs became more abundant, and willow and Dryas less abundant, signifying increased warmth and decreased frost action. At least six tree species, all now common in the area, arrived around Gould Pond between c. 10,800 and 10,500 BP. This rapid transition was coincident with the most rapid major non-anthropogenic change of vegetation at sites across eastern North America during the postglacial period.},

@article{Davis1983c,
abstract = {Sediment cores from nine lakes in southern Norway (N) and six in northern New England (NE) were dated by 37Cs, 210Pb and in NE also by pollen, and were analyzed geochemically and for diatoms. Cores from two N and three NE lakes were analyzed for cladocerans. 37Cs dating is unreliable in these lakes, probably due to mobility of Cs in the sediment. In Holmvatn sediment, an up-core increase in Fe, starting ca. 1900, correlates with geochemical indications of decreasing mechanical erosion of soils. Diatoms indicate a lake acidification starting in the 1920's. We propose that soil Fe was mobilized and runoff acidified by acidic precipitation and/or by soil acidification resulting from vegetational succession following reduced grazing. Even minor land use changes or disturbances in lake watersheds introduce ambiguity to the sedimentary evidence relating to atmospheric influences. Diatom counts from surface sediments in 36 N and 31 NE lakes were regressed against contemporary water pH to obtain coefficients for computing past pH from subsurface counts. Computed decreases of 0.3-0.8 pH units start between 1890 and 1930 in N lakes already acidic (pH 5.0-5.5) before the decrease. These and lesser decreases in other lakes start decades to over a century after the first sedimentary indications of atmospheric heavy metal pollution. It is proposed that the acidification of precipitation accompanied the metal pollution. The delays in lake acidification may be due to buffering by the lakes and watersheds. The magnitude of acidification and heavy metal loading of the lakes parallels air pollution gradients. Shift in cladoceran remains are contemporary with acidification, preceding elimination of fishes.},
