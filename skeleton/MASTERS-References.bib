abstract = {Discharge and annual bedload measurements from the 1.25 km2 South Branch of Birch Brook, NW Massachusetts, show that the annual flux of bedload was 2.0 tons km-2 yr-1 from this forested basin between 1986 and 2000. Sediment transport by the South Branch is controlled by discharge events above bankfull (0.34 m3 s-1) and the relative availability of sediment in the stream channel, particularly material stored by organic debris dams. Peak discharge events explain 91{\%} of the variance in measured sediment discharge on the South Branch during the period 1986 to 1996. After 1996, however, correlation is poor, reflecting a change in sediment availability after sediment year 1996, when sediment flux was 5 times average values. Analyzing the sediment budget for the Birch Brook catchment permits us to speculate about how deforestation, grazing and cultivation in the 19th century affected hillslope erosion and stream sediment load. Higher sediment loads during the past century may have produced the low terraces that line the lower reaches of Birch Brook. The present rate of sediment transport from the Birch Brook catchment suggests that the erosion rate from forested catchments in NW Massachusetts is low.},

abstract = {The post-orogenic evolution of the Laramide landscape of the western U.S. has been characterized by late Cenozoic channel incision of basins and their adjacent ranges. One means of constraining the incision history of basins is dating the remnants of gravel-capped surfaces above modern streams. Here, we focus on an extensive remnant of the Rocky Flats surface between Golden and Boulder, Colorado, and use in situ-produced 10Be and 26Al concentrations in terrace alluvium to constrain the Quaternary history of this surface. Coal and Ralston Creeks, both tributaries of the South Platte River, abandoned the Rocky Flats surface and formed the Verdos and Slocum pediments, which are cut into Cretaceous bedrock between Rocky Flats and the modern stream elevations. Rocky Flats alluvium ranges widely in age, from {\textgreater} 2 Ma to ∼ 400 ka, with oldest ages to the east and younger ages closer to the mountain front. Numerical modeling of isotope concentration depth profiles suggests that individual sites have experienced multiple resurfacing events. Preliminary results indicate that Verdos and Slocum alluvium along Ralston Creek, which is slightly larger than Coal Creek, is several hundred thousand years old. Fluvial incision into these surfaces appears therefore to progress headward in response to downcutting of the South Platte River. The complex ages of these surfaces call into question any correlation of such surfaces based solely on their elevation above the modern channel. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Phosphorus (P) may be liberated from lake sediments by reductive dissolution of Fe(OH)3(S) during periods of hypolimnetic anoxia. P, however, remains adsorbed to Al(OH)3(S) regardless of redox conditions. During chronic or episodic acidification of a catchment, ionic Al is mobilized from soils to receiving waters. A fraction of the mobilized Al may precipitate as a consequence of higher pH of the receiving waters. We hypothesized that phosphorus retention in lake sediments is directly related to the magnitude of Al loading in response to low pH in the watershed. We studied cores representing over 200 years of sediment accumulation in historically acidic Mud Pond and Little Long Pond in eastern Maine, USA. Sequential chemical extractions of sediment were used to assess the history of Al, Fe, and P interactions. Mud Pond is a first-order pond with a pH of {\~{}} 4.7, having acidified slightly in response to anthropogenic acidification from {\~{}} 1930. The inlet stream to Mud Pond has dissolved Al concentrations often exceeding 500 $\mu$g/L, of which more than half is organically-bound. Mud Pond drains into Little Long Pond, a second-order pond with a historical pH of {\textless} 6, and which has shown little pH or alkalinity response to increases or decreases in atmospheric SO42- input. Sequential extractions show that Al and P are predominantly in the 0.1 M NaOH-extractable fraction in the sediments from both ponds throughout the cores. The concentration of the likely biogenic and non-reactive P within the NaOH fraction increases up core from {\textless} 30{\%} to {\~{}} 60{\%}. Extractable Fe ({\textless} 20{\%} of extractable Al) is mainly in the 0.1 M NaOH-extractable fraction, except for the top few cm, which are predominantly in the bicarbonate-dithionite reducible fraction. Accumulation rates of sediment, Al, Fe, and P in both ponds have increased in the last 50-60 yr, but fractions remain in the same proportion. Throughout both sediment cores the molar ratio of specific Al:P fractions greatly exceeds 25, and molar ratio of specific Al:Fe fractions greatly exceeds 3, the thresholds proposed by Kop{\'{a}}{\v{c}}ek et al.

abstract = {Dam removals with unmanaged sediment releases are good opportunities to learn about channel response to abruptly increased bed material supply. Understanding these events is important because they affect aquatic habitats and human uses of floodplains. A longstanding paradigm in geomorphology holds that response rates to landscape disturbance exponentially decay through time. However, a previous study of the Merrimack Village Dam (MVD) removal on the Souhegan River in New Hampshire, USA, showed that an exponential function poorly described the early geomorphic response. Erosion of impounded sediments there was two-phased. We had an opportunity to quantitatively test the two-phase response model proposed for MVD by extending the record there and comparing it with data from the Simkins Dam removal on the Patapsco River in Maryland, USA. The watershed sizes are the same order of magnitude (102km2), and at both sites low-head dams were removed ({\~{}}3–4m) and {\~{}}65 000m3 of sand-sized sediments were discharged to low-gradient reaches. Analyzing four years of repeat morphometry and sediment surveys at the Simkins site, as well as continuous discharge and turbidity data, we observed the two-phase erosion response described for MVD. In the early phase, approximately 50{\%} of the impounded sediment at Simkins was eroded rapidly during modest flows. After incision to base level and widening, a second phase began when further erosion depended on floods large enough to go over bank and access impounded sediments more distant from the newly-formed channel. Fitting functional forms to the data for both sites, we found that two-phase exponential models with changing decay constants fit the erosion data better than single-phase models. Valley width influences the two-phase erosion responses upstream, but downstream responses appear more closely related to local gradient, sediment re-supply from the upstream impoundments, and base flows.

abstract = {The application of in-situ produced cosmogenic isotopes to problems in geomorphology has increased rapidly over the past decade. At least 57 papers and numerous abstracts have been published since the mid-1980s when the first mass-spectrometric measurements of terrestrially produced cosmogenic isotopes were made. Taken at face value, these studies provide quantitative information about rates of landscape evolution and landform age; however, the significance of calculated erosion rates depends strongly on the models used to interpret isotopic data, the validity of assumptions inherent to these models, and the geologic surroundings in which the sample was collected. This paper attempts to place cosmogenic isotope studies in a geomorphic context by reviewing fundamentals of the method and evaluating the validity of assumptions under which these data have been interpreted. At present, the establishment of high-precision, cosmogenically based glacial and alluvial chronologies is stymiedby the evolution of geomorphic surfaces, the erosion of rock from sampled boulders, the potential for isotope inheritance from previous exposure, and the uncertainty of isotopic measurements. Uncertainties in isotope production rates and the observed variability of exposure correlated reliably with those obtained by other techniques. Estimation of erosion rates at single points on the landscape gives useful small-scale information. Extrapolation of these rates over longer time and larger spatial scales is less sure and most likely biased toward lower erosion rates by the inadvertent selection of resistant sample sites. However, because erosion rates are so poorly constrained at present, even estimates to within a factor of 2 may be of significant value to geomorphologists and tectonists.},

abstract = {We used 135-MHz ground-penetrating-radar GPR reflection profiles to determine if high-explosive HE depth bombs were possibly detonated within a small New England lake formerly used as a bombing range, as well as the depths and distribution of inert and possibly unexploded ordnance UXO within the subbottom sediments. Maximum water depth was 8.6 m. The primary munitions were unarmed practice bombs, but terrestrial fragments from HE depth bombs led us to seek stratigraphic obliteration and distortion as evidence of their use. The low water conductivity and quartz-rich sediments provided more than 8 m of subbottom penetration beneath slope and shelf sediments. The high permittivities of the water and subbottom sediments provided good antenna directivity, excellent 2D migrations, multicentimeter vertical resolution, and a unique pulse waveform signature for metal objects. Our line profiles revealed hundreds of subbottom diffractions, which implied an areal distribution of thousands of suspicious objects. Most lay beneath the central basin, but many resided beneath the slopes and shelves as well. Supplementary profiles of a nearby pristine lake and of controlled munitions, a side-scan sonar bottom survey, and time-domain reflectometry dielectric measurements of sediment samples corroborated our findings of natural stratigraphy, a unique metallic diffraction phase signature, the existence of many nonmetallic objects including logs, and subbottom relative permittivities ranging from 28 to 76. The intact natural lacustrine strata, including deltaic foresets and bottom sets, faults, and conformable and unconformable horizons, suggest that live bombs likely did not detonate in the lake. The only stratigraphic disturbances we found were apparent perforations beneath about 1 m of water, within which diffractions of metallic origin originated. The dielectric results and the prominent slope strata over the deepest horizons led us to conclude that the exceptional subbottom penetration existed under predominantly sandy sediments.},

abstract = {Establishing background (geologic) rates of erosion is prerequisite to quantifying the impact of human activities on Earth's surface. Here, we present 10 Be estimates of background erosion rates for ten large (10,000–100,000 km2 ) river basins in the southeastern United States, an area that was cleared of native forest and used intensively for agriculture. These 10 Be-based rates are indicative of the pace at which the North American passive-margin landscape eroded before European settlement ({\~{}}8 m/m.y.). Comparing these background rates to both rates of post-settlement hillslope erosion and to river sediment yields for the same basins, we find that following peak disturbance (late 1800s and early 1900s), rates of hillslope erosion ({\~{}}950 m/m.y.) exceeded 10 Be-determined background rates more than one-hundred fold. Although large-basin sediment yields during peak disturbance increased 5–10× above pre-settlement norms, rivers at the time were transporting only {\~{}}6{\%} of the eroded material; work by others suggests that the bulk of historically eroded material remained and still remains as legacy sediment stored at the base of hillslopes and along valley bottoms.

abstract = {Ground-penetrating radar (GPR, also referred to as ground-probing radar, surface-penetrating radar, subsurface radar, georadar or impulse radar) is a noninvasive geophysical technique that detects electrical discontinuities in the shallow subsurface ({\textless}50 m). It does this by generation, transmission, propagation, reflection and reception of discrete pulses of high-frequency (MHz) electromagnetic energy. During the 1980s radar systems became commercially available, but it was not until the mid-1990s that sedimentary geologists and others began to widely exploit the technique. During the last decade numerous sedimentological studies have used GPR to reconstruct past depositional environments and the nature of sedimentary processes in a variety of environmental settings; to aid hydrogeological investigations, including groundwater reservoir characterisation, and to assist in hydrocarbon reservoir analogue studies. This is because in correctly processed radar profiles, and at the resolution of a survey, primary reflections usually parallel primary depositional structure. Despite the wide use of GPR, a number of fundamental problems remain in its application to sedimentary research. In particular, there are a wide range of approaches to the processing of radar data and interpretation techniques used on the final subsurface images vary widely, with little consensus over a common methodology. This review attempts to illustrate that methods for the collection, processing and interpretation of radar data are intimately linked and that thorough understanding of the nature, limitations and implications of each step is required if realistic sedimentological data are to be generated. In order to extract the maximum amount of meaningful information, the user must understand the scientific principles that underlie the technique, the effects of the data collection regime employed, the implications of the technique's finite resolution and depth of penetration, the nature and causes of reflections unrelated to primary sedimentary structure, and the appropriateness of each processing step with respect to the overall aim of the study. Following suitable processing, a radar stratigraphy approach to reflection profile interpretation should be adopted. New or modified terminologies and techniques to define a radar stratigraphy are also recommended, in order to make the interpretation process more transparent and to avoid confusion with related methodologies such as seismic stratigraphy and sequence stratigraphy. The full potential of GPR in sedimentary research will only be realised if more thorough and systematic approaches to data collection, processing and interpretation are adopted. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Detailed measurements of water content, liquid and plastic limits, electric conductivity, grain-size distribution, specific gravity, and compressibility were performed on the upper 7 m of the lacustrine sequence from the Chalco Basin, Valley of Mexico. Eight stratigraphic units consisting of alternating layers of clay, silt, sand, and gravel of volcanic origin are described for this sequence. The analysis of contrasts in the physical properties permitted to identify potential reflectors of radar waves: (i) change in the electrical conductivity at 0.4 m depth; (ii) increment in the clay and water content at 0.8 m depth; (iii) bimodal behavior of the water content at 1.3 m depth; (iv) increment in the sand content and decrease in water content at 2.6 m depth; and (v) the presence of a pyroclastic unit at 3.7 m depth. Radargrams with frequencies of 900 and 300 MHz were collected on a grid of profiles covering the study area. Correlation of radargrams with the reference section permitted the spatial interpolation of variations in the physical properties and the near-surface stratigraphy. Contrary to the expected in these clayey sediments, electric contrast enhanced by variations in water content and grain size permitted the recording of the near-surface sedimentary structures. Distinctive radar signatures were identified between reflectors. Furthermore, lateral discontinuities of the reflectors and their vertical displacements permitted the identification of deformational features within the sequence. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Yet, understanding past landscape behavior is prerequisite to predicting and mitigating future impacts of human-induced disturbance and climate change. Using northern Vermont as an example, we demonstrate that the sedimentary record preserved in humid-region ponds and alluvial fans can be dated, deciphered isotopically and stratigraphically, and used to understand the history of hillslope erosion. Our data suggest that erosion rates were higher in the early and late Holocene than in the mid-Holocene, perhaps the result of changing climate and the frequency of severe storms. In Vermont, dated alluvial fan sediments reveal that the highest rates of hillslope erosion occurred as a consequence of European settlement. The geologic record of colonial deforestation is clear, revealing significant human impact and suggesting that past landscape response is a meaningul basis for guiding future land management practices.},

abstract = {Contemporary stream sediment loads are dubious indicators of regional denundation. In many larger basins, sediment storage in the form of colluvium and alluvium appears to be much greater than sediment yield. Analysis of 10 large river basins in the southeastern United States indicates that while upland erosion was proceeding at about 95 mm/100 yrs, sediment yield were only about 5.3 mm/100 yrs, a delivery ratio of about 6 percent. Similar sediemt budgets exist int he Driftless Arca. In both regions much of the modern erosional debris is stored int eh stream systems as massive deposits in streams and valleys. Some of these deposits are presently being eroded and are now themselves sources of sediment yields. However, the transport of sediment is significantly impeded by extensive reservoir impoundments, especially in the southeast. Thus, present sediment yields may correlate poorly with upland erosional processes or phenomena such as lithology, climate, vegetation, and land use. Instead, sediment yields may be a reflection of channel efficiency, soil texture, basin morphology, and channel or bank erosion.},

abstract = {AbstractSix water emergencies have occurred since 1981 for the New York City (NYC) region despite the following: 1) its perhumid climate, 2) substantial conservation of water since 1979, and 3) meteorological data showing little severe or extreme drought since 1970. This study reconstructs 472 years of moisture availability for the NYC watershed to place these emergencies in long-term hydroclimatic context. Using nested reconstruction techniques, 32 tree-ring chronologies comprised of 12 species account for up to 66.2{\%} of the average May–August Palmer drought severity index. Verification statistics indicate good statistical skill from 1531 to 2003. The use of multiple tree species, including rarely used species that can sometimes occur on mesic sites like Liriodendron tulipifera, Betula lenta, and Carya spp., seems to aid reconstruction skill. Importantly, the reconstruction captures pluvial events in the instrumental record nearly as well as drought events and is significantly correlated to precipitation...},

abstract = {Gravel-bedded streams are thought to have a characteristic meandering form bordered by a self-formed, fine-grained floodplain. This ideal guides a multibillion-dollar stream restoration industry. We have mapped and dated many of the deposits along mid-Atlantic streams that formed the basis for this widely accepted model. These data, as well as historical maps and records, show instead that before European settlement, the streams were small anabranching channels within extensive vegetated wetlands that accumulated little sediment but stored substantial organic carbon. Subsequently, 1 to 5 meters of slackwater sedimentation, behind tens of thousands of 17th- to 19th-century milldams, buried the presettlement wetlands with fine sediment. These findings show that most floodplains along mid-Atlantic streams are actually fill terraces, and historically incised channels are not natural archetypes for meandering streams.},

abstract = {The logistical demands of coring lake sediments tend to preclude the replicate coring necessary to establish error estimates for measured sedimentary parameters. However, if such parameters are to be used to reconstruct sediment yield, and particularly to identify temporal variability of sediment yield, reasonable error estimates are required. In this paper data from a series of alpine lakes in British Columbia are applied to develop a new method for deriving such estimates. Regression surfaces fitted to point values of sediment mass are used to model the physically controlled spatial variability of sedimentation. Deviations from these surfaces are assumed to represent remaining unstructured variance, which constitutes a conservative error estimate. Application of the technique to the alpine lake dataset gives sediment yield estimates with error ranges of 7-21 per cent. The potential error is minimized where the spatial variability of sedimentation is strongly predictable. The best fits were achieved for elongate lakes of simple basin morphology. The range of the error estimates is sufficiently low to allow detection of variability in Holocene sediment yield to one of the lakes. By using this technique, absolute sediment yields with associated error estimates may be derived. The associated gains in precision justify multicore approaches to lake sediment-based reconstructions of sediment yield. Copyright 2000 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {In 2009, the U.S. Geological Survey entered into a coop- erative agreement with the International Joint Commission, St. Croix River Board to do an analysis of historical small- mouth bass habitat as a function of lake level for Spednic Lake in an effort to quantify the effects, if any, of historical lake- level management and meteorological conditions (from 1970 to 2009) on smallmouth bass year-class failure. The analysis requires estimating habitat availability as a function of lake level during spawning periods from 1970 to 2009, which is documented in this report. Field work was done from Octo- ber 19 to 23, and from November 2 to 10, 2009, to acquire acoustic bathymetric (depth) data and acoustic data indicating the character of the surficial lake-bottom sediments. Historical lake-level data during smallmouth bass spawning (May-June) were applied to the bathymetric and surficial-sediment type data sets to produce annual historic estimates of smallmouth- bass-spawning-habitat area. Results show that minimum lake level during the spawning period explained most of the variability (R2 = 0.89) in available spawning habitat for nearshore areas of shallow slope (less than 10 degrees) on the basis of linear correlation. The change in lake level during the spawning period explained most of the variability (R2 = 0.90) in available spawning habitat for areas of steeper slopes (10 to 40 degrees) on the basis of linear correlation. The next step in modeling historic smallmouth bass year-class persistence is to combine this analysis of the effects of lake-level management on habitat availability with meteorological conditions.

abstract = {The persistence of topography within ancient orogens remains one of the outstanding questions in landscape evolution. In the eastern North American Appalachians, this question is manifest in the outstanding problem of whether topographic relief is in a quasi-equilibrium state, decaying slowly over many millennia, or whether relief has increased during the late Cenozoic. Here we present quantitative geomorphic data from the nonglaciated portion of the Susquehanna River drainage basin that provide insight into these end-member models. Analysis of channel profiles draining upland catchments in the northern Valley and Ridge, Appalachian Plateau, Blue Ridge, and Piedmont provinces reveals that a large number of streams have well defined knickpoints clustered at 300-600m elevation but not systematically associated with transitions from weak to resistant substrate. Cosmogenic 10Be inventories of modern stream sediment indicate that erosion rates are spatially variable, ranging from {\~{}}5-30m/Myr above knickpoints to {\~{}}50-100m/Myr below knickpoints. Overall, channel gradients, normalized for drainage area, scale linearly with catchment-averaged erosion rates. Collectively, regionally consistent spatial relationships among erosion rate, channel steepness, and knickpoints reveal an ongoing wave of transient channel adjustment to a change in relative base level. Reconstructions of relict channel profiles above knickpoints suggest that higher rates of incision are associated with {\~{}}100-150m of relative base level fall that accompanied epierogenic rock uplift rather than a change to a more erosive climate or drainage reorganization. Channel response timescales imply that the onset of relative base level change predates {\~{}}3.5Ma and may have begun as early as {\~{}}15Ma. We suggest that adjustment of the channel network was likely driven by changes in mantle dynamics along the eastern seaboard of North America during the Neogene. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We developed two-dimensional computational fluid hydraulics–habitat suitability index (CFD–HSI) models to identify and qualitatively assess potential zones of shallow water depth and high water velocity that may present passage challenges for five major anadromous fish species in a 2.63-km reach of the main stem Penobscot River, Maine, as a result of a dam removal downstream of the reach. Suitability parameters were based on distribution of fish lengths and body depths and transformed to cruising, maximum sustained and sprint swimming speeds. Zones of potential depth and velocity challenges were calculated based on the hydraulic models; ability of fish to pass a challenge zone was based on the percent of river channel that the contiguous zone spanned and its maximum along-current length. Three river flows (low: 99.1m3 sec-1; normal: 344.9m3 sec-1; and high:792.9m3 sec-1) were modelled to simulate existing hydraulic conditions and hydraulic conditions simulating removal of a dam at the downstream boundary of the reach. Potential depth challenge zones were nonexistent for all low-flow simulations of existing conditions for deeper-bodied fishes. Increasing flows for existing conditions and removal of the dam under all flow conditions increased the number and size of potential velocity challenge zones, with the effects of zones being more pronounced for smaller species. The two-dimensional CFD–HSI model has utility in demonstrating gross effects of flow and hydraulic alteration, but may not be as precise a predictive tool as a three-dimensional model. Passability of the potential challenge zones cannot be precisely quantified for two-dimensional or three-dimensional models due to untested assumptions and incomplete data on fish swimming performance and behaviours.

abstract = {Landscape form represents the cumulative effects of de-stabilizing events relative to recovery processes. Most geomorphic research has focused on the role of episodic rare events on landscape form with less attention paid to the role and persistence of chronic inputs. To better establish the interplay between chronic and episodic extreme events at regional scales, we used aerial photography and post-flood sediment sampling to assess stream and hillslope response and recovery to a 100-300yr. flood caused by Tropical Storm Irene in New England. Within a 14 000km super(2) study area, analysis of aerial photographs indicated that the storm initiated (n=534) and reactivated (n=460) a large number of landslides. These landslides dramatically increased overall estimates of regional erosion rates (from 0.0023mm/yr. without Irene to 0.0072mm/yr. with Irene). Similarly, Irene-generated LWD inputs of 0.25-0.5 trees/km exceeded annual background rates in a single event, and these concentrated inputs (10 super(1)-10 super(2) of trees/landslide) are likely to result in large jams and snags that are particularly persistent and geomorphically effective. Finally, we found that landslide scars continue to provide elevated sediment inputs years after the event, as evidenced by sustained higher suspended sediment concentrations in streams with Irene-generated landslides. Overall, our results indicate that infrequent, high-magnitude events have a more important geomorphic role in tectonically stable, more moderate-relief systems than has been previously recognized. Understanding the role of these events has particular relevance in regions such as New England, where the frequency and magnitude of extreme storms is expected to increase. Further, these effects may force reconsideration of conservation and restoration targets (for example in channel form and large wood loading and distribution) in fluvial systems.},

A total of nine sediment cores (4.5–6 m long) were taken near the base of stream delta foreslopes. End-member modeling of the particle-size frequency distributions from each core produces 3–5 representative end member distributions, or end members (EMs). Concurrent increases in mean and median particle size, and in the relative abundance of the coarsest EM(s), indicate increased transport capacity of inflowing tributaries, resulting from rainstorms. In all 9 cores, particle size data show clear signs of episodic, high-energy sediment transport events where proxy measurements such as loss-on-ignition and magnetic susceptibility do not, demonstrating the sensitivity of particle size analysis in paleostorm investigations made using lake sediment cores. Floods caused by storms in this region peaked around 1.4, 2.1, 3.0, 3.9, 6.8, 8.2, and 11.5 ka cal BP, and presently appear to be increasing in frequency. Periods of storminess in New Hampshire and Maine correlate well with other records of precipitation and climate in the northeastern United States during the Holocene, further supporting modern records which show tropical air masses as a primary driver of extreme precipitation events in New England (Ludlum 1996; Konrad 2001; Sisson and Gyakum 2004).},

abstract = {Turbidites within Holocene lacustrine sediment cores occur worldwide and are valued deposits that record a history of earthquakes or storms. Without sedimentary architecture however, interpretation of the cause, provenance, and behaviour of their parent turbidity currents are speculative. Here, these interpretations are made from 2D ground-penetrating radar (GPR) images of shore-to-shore architecture beneath three, previously-cored lakes within the low seismicity New England (U.S.A) region. Shallow depths, low water and sediment conductivities, and signal sensitivity to density contrasts uniquely provided up to 30 m of sediment signal penetration. Core comparisons and signal analysis reveal most horizons represent multi-decimetre-thick clusters of Holocene turbidites, which are denser than their organic-rich silt matrix. Some horizons also represent erosional unconformities and sediment bypass interfaces. The key, common, architectural consequences of turbidity current activity include limited foreset progradation, conformably pinched or unconformable layers of organic-rich sediment onlapped against slopes beneath 5–6 m of water, and mounded stratified sediments beneath rises. These features indicate that turbidity currents repeatedly bypassed the same slope without deposition and regardless of dip, and then simultaneously armoured and bypassed inter-turbidite sediment along rises and basins to provide basinward, generally age-conformable accumulation. The mounding precludes significant basinward focusing. Variable horizon amplitude suggests meter-scale changes in armouring density. Unconformities localized near breaks in dip beneath slopes suggest erosive hydraulic jumps. One lake shows evidence of historically maintained channels associated with specific deltas. Shelf strata indicating inland current generation, similar key architecture in other, uncored lakes, countable, lake-wide horizons, and absent slumps, slides, and faults are consistent with storm-driven turbidity currents, and with previous, core-based conclusions that severe, Holocene storms were episodic throughout this region. The results generalize marine bypass and armouring to lacustrine settings, and so likely occur worldwide in lakes subject only to storms, including lakes where GPR may locate core sites.},

abstract = {The linking of on-site rates of erosion and soil loss within a drainage basin to the sediment yield at the basin outlet, and improved knowledge and representation of the associated processes of sediment delivery, represent a major research need within the field of erosion and sedimentation and also an important scale problem in drainage basin studies. This paper reviews the limitations of the sediment delivery ratio concept by considering the problems of temporal and spatial lumping and its blackbox nature. Some recent advances in our understanding of the sediment delivery system and its modelling are described and the lack of detailed empirical investigations is highlighted. The significance of recent concern for the role of sediments in the transport of nutrients and contaminants to sediment delivery studies is introduced, and the need for further work in this field is emphasised. {\textcopyright} 1983.},

abstract = {Bear Brook Watershed in Maine (BBWM) consists of a pair of research watersheds, East Bear Brook (EBB) and West Bear Brook (WBB), Years of research and observations have shown both watersheds have high similarity in geographic and hydrologic characteristics; a simple comparison of hydrographs from these two watersheds further substantiates this similarity. The Object Watershed Link Simulation (OWLS) model was developed and used to simulate the hydrological processes within the BBWM. The OWLS model is a 3-dimensional, vector-based, visualized, physically-based distributed watershed hydrologic model. Simulation results not only provide a close examination of hydrologic processes within a watershed, but also dynamically visualize the processes of flow separations and Variable Source Areas (VSA), Results from flow separations suggest that surface flow from riparian area is the predominate component for the flood rising limb and that macropore flow from riparian area dominates during the falling limb. Soil matrix flow has little effect during flood period but is a persistent contributor to base flow. Results from VSA visualization demonstrate 3-D dynamic changes in surface flow distribution and suggest that downstream riparian areas are the major contributing area for peak flow. As water chemistry is highly relevant to the flow paths within a watershed, simulations have provided valuable information about source of stream flow and the water migration dynamics to support the study of watershed chemistry in the BBWM. More specific linkages between the chemistry behavior and the dynamic hydrologic processes should become the next simulation effort in the watershed study. There are many questions that art critical to watershed chemistry studies like: which flow component (surface flow, macropore flow, soil matrix flow) predominates during peak flows? How do the flow components distribute during a flood event? How do flow contributions differ between these two watersheds? Which portion of the watershed contributes the most to the peak flows? These questions remain unknown from previous observations and only can be addressed with a physically-based distributed model.},

abstract = {We analyzed lake sediment deposits and local hydrometric records to assess the potential for developing a high-resolution record of sediment delivery from the Rock Lake catchment, situated in the non-glacierized Front Ranges of the Rocky Mountains, Canada. Rhythmic couplets of silt-clay characterized the clastic sediments recovered from the deep central basin of the lake. Contemporary sediment yield to Rock Lake (10.7 +/- A 1.8 Mg km(-2) year(-1)) is comparable to other studied Canadian Cordillera lakes that have sedimentary lithologies and absence of glacier cover, but distinct rhythmic deposition is relatively unique to this basin. Spatial patterns of deposition within the lake were assessed by correlating rhythmites between multiple sediment cores and by sub-bottom, acoustic profiling. Bracketed dates for a spatially continuous sequence of eight thick rhythmites were established by correlating laminations between core samples collected more than 30 years apart. We identified a consistent pattern between the rhythmite and hydrometric data series between 1975 and 2006 and determined that specific flooding events caused by summer rainstorms are associated with each of the eight thick rhythmites. We observed a good relationship between rhythmite thickness and total flood volume that exceeded a threshold discharge. Acoustic profiling showed that the lake could be a good candidate for longer-term proxy development. We discuss how some of the methods used in this study could benefit ongoing paleoenvironmental assessments based on lacustrine rhythmite series.},

abstract = {Reconstructions of glacioisostatic rebound based on relative sea level in Maine and adjacent Canada do not agree well with existing geophysical models. In order to understand these discrepancies better, we investigated the lake-level history of 40-km-long Moosehead Lake in northwestern Maine. Glacioisostasy has affected the level of Moosehead Lake since deglaciation ca. 12,500 14 C yr B.P. Lowstand features at the southeastern end and an abandoned outlet at the northwestern end of the lake indicate that the lake basin was tilted down to the northwest, toward the retreating ice sheet, by 0.7 m/km at 10,000 14 C yr B.P. Water level then rose rapidly in the southeastern end of the lake, and the northwestern outlet was abandoned, indicating rapid relaxation of landscape tilt. Lowstand features at the northwestern end of the lake suggest that the lake basin was tilted to the southeast at ca. 8750 14 C yr B.P., possibly as the result of a migrating isostatic forebulge. After 8000 14 C yr B.P., water level at the southeastern end was again below present lake level and rose gradually thereafter. We found no evidence suggesting that postglacial climate change significantly affected lake level. The rebound history inferred from lake-level data is consistent with previous interpretations of nearby relative sea-level data, which indicate a significantly steeper and faster-moving ice-proximal depression and ice-distal forebulge than geophysical models predict.},

abstract = {Annually laminated (varved) sediments from Lake Kallio-Kourujarvi, Central Finland, provide high-resolution sedimentological data for the last three millennia. These varves consist of two laminae that represent (1) deposition during the spring-to-autumn growing season, composed of degraded organic matter and a variety of microfossils, and (2) deposition during winter, composed of fine-grained homogenous organic matter. Because of the absence of a clastic lamina, these varves differ from the typical, well-described, clastic-organic varve sequences in Fennoscandian lakes. Such organic varves in Finnish lakes have not been studied in detail before. Three thousand varves were counted and their seasonal deposition was distinguished. Comparison of varve thickness with meteorological data revealed a positive correlation between organic varve thickness and precipitation. This suggests that catchment erosion processes and consequent organic matter and nutrient inputs are important factors in organic varve formation. The correlation between temperature and growing-season lamina thickness varied from insignificant, to positive, to negative during different time spans. This suggests that organic matter accumulation can sometimes have a significant, but unpredictable role in organic varve formation, via organic matter production and degradation, processes that are influenced strongly by water column temperature. The organic varves of Lake Kallio-Kourujarvi enable a unique, high-resolution approach for the study of past climate and environment. Our results suggest that decadal periods of increased precipitation occurred during BP 2150-2090, 1710-1620, 1410-1360, 920-870 (1030-1080 AD), and after 370 BP (1580 AD). Dryer intervals occurred during BP 2750-2720, 1900-1850, 1800-1740, 1600-1500, and 780-700 (1170-1250 AD), 590-520 (1360-1430 AD).},

Marine waters, much colder than those in the present Gulf of Maine, covered the site at the time of deglaciation (c. 13,200 BP). Plants characteristic of modem tundra grew on nearby uplands. Marine recession, due to isostatic rebound of the land, occurred from c. 12,800-12,200 BP. The lake water was completely freshened by 12,000 BP. A sparse shrub-herb tundra became established around Gould Pond as marine waters receded. Subsequent to 11,300 BP, sedges and other herbs became more abundant, and willow and Dryas less abundant, signifying increased warmth and decreased frost action. At least six tree species, all now common in the area, arrived around Gould Pond between c. 10,800 and 10,500 BP. This rapid transition was coincident with the most rapid major non-anthropogenic change of vegetation at sites across eastern North America during the postglacial period.},

abstract = {Climate models show that ice-sheet melt will dominate sea-level rise over the coming centuries, but our understanding of ice-sheet variations before the last interglacial 125,000 years ago remains fragmentary. This is because terrestrial deposits of ancient glacial and interglacial periods1, 2, 3 are overrun and eroded by more recent glacial advances, and are therefore usually rare, isolated and poorly dated4. In contrast, material shed almost continuously from continents is preserved as marine sediment that can be analysed to infer the time-varying state of major ice sheets. Here we show that the East Greenland Ice Sheet existed over the past 7.5 million years, as indicated by beryllium and aluminium isotopes (10Be and 26Al) in quartz sand removed by deep, ongoing glacial erosion on land and deposited offshore in the marine sedimentary record5, 6. During the early Pleistocene epoch, ice cover in East Greenland was dynamic; in contrast, East Greenland was mostly ice-covered during the mid-to-late Pleistocene. The isotope record we present is consistent with distinct signatures of changes in ice sheet behaviour coincident with major climate transitions. Although our data are continuous, they are from low-deposition-rate sites and sourced only from East Greenland. Consequently, the signal of extensive deglaciation during short, intense interglacials could be missed or blurred, and we cannot distinguish between a remnant ice sheet in the East Greenland highlands and a diminished continent-wide ice sheet. A clearer constraint on the behaviour of the ice sheet during past and, ultimately, future interglacial warmth could be produced by 10Be and 26Al records from a coring site with a higher deposition rate. Nonetheless, our analysis challenges the possibility of complete and extended deglaciation over the past several million years.},

abstract = {The major uncertainty in relating cosmogenic-nuclide exposure ages to ages measured by other dating methods comes from extrapolating nuclide production rates measured at globally scattered calibration sites to the sites of unknown age that are to be dated. This uncertainty can be reduced by locating production rate calibration sites that are similar in location and age to the sites to be dated. We use this strategy to reconcile exposure age and radiocarbon deglaciation chronologies for northeastern North America by compiling 10Be production rate calibration measurements from independently dated late-glacial and early Holocene ice-marginal landforms in this region. 10Be production rates measured at these sites are 6-12{\%} lower than predicted by the commonly accepted global 10Be calibration data set used with any published production rate scaling scheme. In addition, the regional calibration data set shows significantly less internal scatter than the global calibration data set. Thus, this calibration data set can be used to improve both the precision and accuracy of exposure dating of regional late-glacial events. For example, if the global calibration data set is used to calculate exposure ages, the exposure-age deglaciation chronology for central New England is inconsistent with the deglaciation chronology inferred from radiocarbon dating and varve stratigraphy. We show that using the regional data set instead makes the exposure age and radiocarbon chronologies consistent. This increases confidence in correlating exposure ages of ice-marginal landforms in northeastern North America with glacial and climate events dated by other means. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Rates of long-term erosion across the Rocky Mountain region help to constrain the relative roles of tectonic uplift, climatic change and rock resistance in sculpting the modern landscape. We measured concentrations of cosmogenic nuclides in quartz extracted from stream sediment from 13 catchments to provide estimates of erosion rates at time scales from103 to 105 yr. Preliminary analysis of 10Be activity from small ({\textless} 50 km2), upland catchments in Colorado and Wyoming indicates that the landscape is lowering at rates between 14 and 250 m/MY in this semiarid area. We sampled basins that: (1) have not been glaciated; (2) have only small volumes of sediment stored beneath terraces and in colluvium, and (3) display minimal evidence for anthropogenic disturbance. We measured the 10Be content of the 250 to 710 mm sand fraction collected in cross-channel transects. Our initial data do not show strong influence of basin relief, average slope, drainage area, tectonic environment, or climate. However, the range of erosion rates from different lithologies suggests that relative rock resistance exerts strong control on landform evolution in the Rocky Mountain region. Catchments draining weathered Precambrian basement (granites and gneisses) typical of the northern Front, Laramie and Medicine Bow Ranges give erosion rates of 18 to 30 (24± 6; n=9) m/MY. Weakly lithified Middle and Upper Cenozoic basin fill is eroding at rates of 45 to 250 m/MY at sites in southern Wyoming and northern Colorado. Precambrian quartzite exposed in the eastern Uinta Mountains gave a rate of 14 m/MY, the lowest we measured. Erosion rates measured in upland granitic and gneissic catchments in Colorado are comparable to those measured in other non-orogenic areas such as the southern Appalachians. If our initial measurements for erosion rates of weakly lithified basin fill are typical, most of the middle and late Cenozoic fill in the greater Wyoming area could have been stripped in the past 5 to 10 million years.},

abstract = {Sediment cores from nine lakes in southern Norway (N) and six in northern New England (NE) were dated by 37Cs, 210Pb and in NE also by pollen, and were analyzed geochemically and for diatoms. Cores from two N and three NE lakes were analyzed for cladocerans. 37Cs dating is unreliable in these lakes, probably due to mobility of Cs in the sediment. In Holmvatn sediment, an up-core increase in Fe, starting ca. 1900, correlates with geochemical indications of decreasing mechanical erosion of soils. Diatoms indicate a lake acidification starting in the 1920's. We propose that soil Fe was mobilized and runoff acidified by acidic precipitation and/or by soil acidification resulting from vegetational succession following reduced grazing. Even minor land use changes or disturbances in lake watersheds introduce ambiguity to the sedimentary evidence relating to atmospheric influences. Diatom counts from surface sediments in 36 N and 31 NE lakes were regressed against contemporary water pH to obtain coefficients for computing past pH from subsurface counts. Computed decreases of 0.3-0.8 pH units start between 1890 and 1930 in N lakes already acidic (pH 5.0-5.5) before the decrease. These and lesser decreases in other lakes start decades to over a century after the first sedimentary indications of atmospheric heavy metal pollution. It is proposed that the acidification of precipitation accompanied the metal pollution. The delays in lake acidification may be due to buffering by the lakes and watersheds. The magnitude of acidification and heavy metal loading of the lakes parallels air pollution gradients. Shift in cladoceran remains are contemporary with acidification, preceding elimination of fishes.},

abstract = {Catastrophic geomorphic events are taken as those that are large, sudden, and rare on human timescales. In the nonglaciated, low-seismicity central Appalachians, these are dominantly floods and landslides. Evaluation of the role of catastrophic events in landscape evolution includes assessment of their contributions to denudation and formation of prominent landscape features, and how they vary through space and time. Tropical storm paths and topographic barriers at the Blue Ridge and Allegheny Front create significant climatic variability across the Appalachians. For moderate floods, the influence of basin geology is apparent in modifying severity of flooding, but for the most extreme events, flood discharges relate mainly to rainfall characteristics such as intensity, duration, storm size, and location. Landslide susceptibility relates more directly to geologic controls that determine what intensity and duration of rainfall will trigger slope instability. Large floods and landslides are not necessarily effective in producing prominent geomorphic features. Large historic floods in the Piedmont have been minimally effective in producing prominent and persistent geomorphic features. In contrast, smaller floods in the Valley and Ridge produced erosional and depositional features that probably will require thousands of years to efface. Scars and deposits of debris slide-avalanches triggered on sandstone ridges recover slowly and persist much longer than scars and deposits of smaller landslides triggered on finer-grained regolith, even though the smaller landslides may have eroded greater aggregate volume. The surficial stratigraphic record can be used to extend the spatial and temporal limits of our knowledge of catastrophic events. Many prominent alluvial and colluvial landforms in the central Appalachians are composed of sediments that were deposited by processes similar to those observed in historic catastrophic events. Available stratigraphic evidence shows two scales of temporal variation: one related to Quaternary climate changes and a more-recent, higher-frequency variation due to rare events during the Holocene. In much of the central Appalachians, landforms related to Quaternary climate changes persist as the most prominent features, despite the modifying effects of late-Holocene catastrophic events. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Quantifying the topography of rivers and their associated bedforms has been a fundamental concern of fluvial geomorphology for decades. Such data, acquired at high temporal and spatial resolutions, are increasingly in demand for process-oriented investigations of flow hydraulics, sediment dynamics and in-stream habitat. In these riverine environments, the most challenging region for topographic measurement is the wetted, submerged channel. Generally, dry bed topography and submerged bathymetry are measured using different methods and technology. This adds to the costs, logistical challenges and data processing requirements of comprehensive river surveys. However, some technologies are capable of measuring the submerged topography. Through-water photogrammetry and bathymetric LiDAR are capable of reasonably accurate measurements of channel beds in clear water. While the cost of bathymetric LiDAR remains high and its resolution relatively coarse, the recent developments in photogrammetry using Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms promise a fundamental shift in the accessibility of topographic data for a wide range of settings. Here we present results demonstrating the potential of so called SfM-photogrammetry for quantifying both exposed and submerged fluvial topography at the mesohabitat scale. We show that imagery acquired from a rotary-winged Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) can be processed in order to produce digital elevation models (DEMs) with hyperspatial resolutions (c. 0.02m) for two different river systems over channel lengths of 50-100m. Errors in submerged areas range from 0.016m to 0.089m, which can be reduced to between 0.008m and 0.053m with the application of a simple refraction correction. This work therefore demonstrates the potential of UAS platforms and SfM-photogrammetry as a single technique for surveying fluvial topography at the mesoscale (defined as lengths of channel from c.10m to a few hundred metres).

The capacity-inflow (C/I) ratio is found to offer a much closer correlation with trap efficiency than the capacity-watershed (C/W) ratio heretofore widely used. It appears likely from the cases studied that accurate timing of venting or sluicing operations to intercept gravity underflows can treble or quadruple the amount of sediment discharged from a reservoir. Desilting basins, because of their shape and method of operation, may have trap efficiencies above 90{\%} even with very low C/I ratios. Semi-dry reservoirs with high C/I ratios, like John Martin Reservoir, may have trap efficiencies as low as 60{\%}. Truly "dry" reservoirs, such as those in the Miami Conservancy District, probably have trap efficiencies in the 10 to 40{\%} range, depending upon C/I ratio},

abstract = {Abstract Radioactive fallout 137Cs (cesium-137) deposited across the landscape from atmospheric nuclear tests is strongly absorbed on soil particles limiting its movement by chemical and biological processes. Most 137Cs movement in the environment is by physical processes; therefore, 137Cs is a unique tracer for studying erosion and sedimentation. Cesium-137 loss from a watershed has been shown to correlate strongly with soil loss calculated by the Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) or measured from small runoff plates. By measuring spatial patterns of 137Cs in vertical and horizontal planes across the landscape, rates of soil loss or deposition can be measured for different parts of a watershed. Even within landscape units, redistribution of soil can be mapped and erosion or deposition rates for different parts of individual fields measured and mapped. Sediment accumulation rates can be measured by comparing the vertical distribution of 137Cs in sediments with the temporal deposition of fallout 137Cs from the atmosphere to locate sediment horizons. Using these dated sediment horizons, sediment accumulation rates can be measured. Interpretations about the location of these dated horizons must consider particle size of the sediments, reworking of deposited sediments, diffusional movement of 137Cs, and time rates of physical process in the sedimentation process. The 137Cs technique can be used to determine sediment accumulation rates in a wide variety of depositional environments including reservoirs, lakes, wetlands, coastal areas, and floodplains. The bibliography shows that 137Cs has been used widely for studying erosion and sedimentation in many different environments around the world.},

These data can be used to design future sediment-sampling programs to assess the quality of streambed sediments and evaluate the health of the Penobscot River. This report describes the results of the sediment survey and the methods used to collect, analyze, and interpret the data used to create maps of streambed-sedi- ment types in the study area. Deposits of fine-grained sediments (mud and sand) are scattered along the shorelines of the mainland and the islands and at the downstream ends of islands and at the mouths of brooks and streams. The most extensive depositional areas were found in the Mattaseunk Dam impoundment near Medway. The main areas of the river channel consist primarily of gravel, sand, and rock.},

abstract = {For more than a century, geologists have sought to measure the distribution of erosion rates on Earth's dynamic surface. Since the mid-1980s, measurements of in situ 10Be, a cosmogenic radionuclide, have been used to estimate outcrop and basin-scale erosion rates at 87 sites around the world. Here, we compile, normalize, and compare published 10Be erosion rate data (n = 1599) in order to understand how, on a global scale, geologic erosion rates integrated over 103 to 106 years vary between climate zones, tectonic settings, and different rock types. Drainage basins erode more quickly (mean = 218 m Myr−1; median = 54 m Myr−1) than outcrops (mean = 12 m Myr−1; median = 5.4 m Myr−1), likely reflecting the acceleration of rock weathering rates under soil. Drainage basin and outcrop erosion rates both vary by climate zone, rock type, and tectonic setting. On the global scale, environmental parameters (latitude, elevation, relief, mean annual precipitation and temperature, seismicity, basin slope and area, and percent basin cover by vegetation) explain erosion rate variation better when they are combined in multiple regression analyses than when considered in bivariate relationships. Drainage basin erosion rates are explained well by considering these environmental parameters (R2 = 0.60); mean basin slope is the most powerful regressor. Outcrop erosion rates are less well explained (R2 = 0.32), and no one parameter dominates. The variance of erosion rates is better explained when subpopulations of the global data are analyzed. While our compilation is global, the grouped spatial distribution of cosmogenic studies introduces a bias that will only be addressed by research in under-sampled regions.},

abstract = {Land use changes, such as deforestation and agricultural expansion, increase soil erosion on the scale of hillslopes and small drainage basins. However, the effects of these changes on the sediment load in rivers is poorly quantified, with a few studies scattered globally, and only 10 data points in the world's most populous nation, China. At 20 different sites in western China, we compare contemporary fluvial sediment yield data collected daily over 4 to 26 years between 1945 and 1987 (median=19years) to long-term measures of sediment generation based on new isotopic measurements of in situ 10Be in river sediments. We find that median sediment yield at these sites exceeds background sediment generation rates by a factor of two (from 0.13 to 5.79 times, median 1.85 times) and that contemporary sediment yield is statistically significantly different from long-term sediment generation rates (p {\textless}0.05). Agricultural land use is directly and significantly proportional to the ratio of contemporary sediment yield to long term sediment generation rates (Spearman correlation coefficient rho=0.52, p{\textless}0.05). We support these findings by calculating erosion indices (following Brown et al., 1988), which compare the delivery of meteoric 10Be to each watershed with the export of meteoric 10Be bound to riverine sediment. Erosion indices are also directly and significantly proportional to agricultural land use (rho=0.58, p{\textless}0.05). Together, these data sets suggest that upstream agricultural land use has significantly increased sediment supply to rivers in western China, likely increasing turbidity and decreasing ecosystem services such as fisheries.},

abstract = {Marine features associated with Late Quaternary isostatic adjustment are well documented in central and coastal Maine, United States. However, the effects of glacially induced land-surface tilting in the interior of the state and its affects on coastal landforms are not well understood. Investigations at Moosehead Lake, Maine's largest lake, indicates that isostatically forced tilting shifted the lake's outlet from the Penobscot River drainage to the Kennebec River drainage, resulting in a significant effect on marine delta formation through changes in the discharge and competence of the Kennebec and Penobscot Rivers, two of the largest in the region. Historic stream-gage data are used as an analogue to quantify the effect of the outlet shift on the relative discharge of these two rivers. These data suggest that, in the upper portions of the watersheds, the Penobscot River lost approximately 25{\%} of its annual discharge, while the Kennebec River experienced an approximately 74{\%} increase in annual discharge. The timing of this change, established in the abandoned lake outlet into the Penobscot River, coincides with the end of deposition of the Penobscot paleodelta in Penobscot Bay and the onset of deposition of the western lobe of the Kennebec paleodelta. This indicates that changing river discharges were also linked to changes in sediment loads at the rivers' mouths. In addition, these findings imply that coarse-grained fluvial deposits (North Anson Formation) identified in the upper Kennebec valley may be the result of the rapid and large increase in river discharge associated with the divide shift. Recognition of both marine and fluvial features associated with isostatic adjustment emphasizes the importance of this process on early postglacial landscape formation.},

After 11,000 B.P. organic-rich sediments were focused into the deeper parts of the basin, and no sediment accumulated in water {\textless} 5 m deep. Late-glacial particulate inorganic inputs were 33 times greater than modern losses from forested watersheds at Hubbard Brook. After trees became established, inorganic inputs fell sharply to modern levels. Late-glacial organic inputs were half the average during the last 11,000 yr. At 4 of the sites studied, accumulation rates reached a maximum between 7000 and 4000 B.P. The precise date varies from site, to site, suggesting that it would be misleading to link peak accumulation in a single core to events in the watershed. After 4000 B.P. organic sediment accumulation rates declined at all 4 sites. Parallel declines in accumulation rates of both pollen and inorganic sediments suggest that this decline is due to the process of sediment focusing rather than to a change in decomposition rates or in organic inputs related to autochthonous or allochthonous primary production.},

abstract = {Deltas formed in Lake Hitchcock, a glacial lake that developed in the Connecticut River Valley, New England, between ∼18.3 and 12.5 ka. The heights of topset/foreset contacts of these deltas presently increase northward, linearly, at rate of ∼0.9 m/km. Others have interpreted this as indicating that isostatic rebound did not begin until after the lake drained, several kiloyears after glacial retreat began. However, (non-elastic) adjustment of Earth's lithosphere to changing loads is known to occur on time scales of years. Late-glacial shoreline features elsewhere in New England also increase in elevation with distance from the LGM margin at ∼0.9 m/km, suggesting that this is a result of fundamental properties of the crust and mantle, and independent of the history of glacier retreat. On the basis of a numerical model of flexure of the lithosphere beneath a circular load, we suggest that deflection of the lithosphere is remarkably linear in a zone 50–200 km wide between the retreating ice margin and a forebulge, and that initial rebound of this zone is spatially quite uniform for some kiloyears before differential rebound starts. Thus, lake shorelines, formed over a period of some centuries during deglaciation would, today, rise linearly northward.},

abstract = {The complex interplay of biological, physical, and chemical processes in pedogenesis and hillslope evolution limits our ability to predict and interpret landscape dynamics. Here, we synthesize a suite of observations from the steep, forested Oregon Coast Range to analyze the role of trees in topographic modification and bedrock-to-soil conversion. Using topographic data derived from airborne lidar, we demonstrate that the topographic signature of forest-driven soil and bedrock disturbance is pervasive. For length scales greater than 7.5. m, the land surface is defined by ridge-valley landforms, whereas smaller scales are dominated by pit-mound features generated by the turnover of large coniferous trees. From field surveys, the volume of bedrock incorporated in overturned rootwads increases rapidly with diameter for large conifers, reflecting the highly nonlinear increase in root biomass with tree diameter. Because trees younger than 60. years detach negligible bedrock, short timber harvest intervals may limit the extent to which root systems penetrate bedrock and facilitate bedrock fracturing and biogeochemical weathering. Using ground-penetrating radar, we show that the rootwads of large trees root achieve substantial penetration (1-3. m) into shallow bedrock. The radar transects also reveal that variations in soil thickness have characteristic length scales of 1 to 5. m, consistent with the scale of large rootwads, indicating that both the landscape surface and soil-bedrock interface exhibit a biogenic imprint. In our study area, the residence time of bedrock within dense rooting zones directly below large trees is similar to the time required for trees to occupy the entire forest floor through multiple cycles of forest succession, suggesting that biological modification of shallow bedrock is ubiquitous. Given increases in erosion rate, the ability of roots to initiate soil production may decline as bedrock exhumation through the biotic zone is rapid relative to the time required for successive forests and their associated root systems to fracture bedrock. As a result, in rapidly eroding terrain the coupling between biotic and abiotic weathering processes (such as exfoliation fracturing) may dictate the maximum rate of bedrock-to-soil conversion. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Establishment of water quality criteria to guide catchment sediment management is required by the European Union (EU) Water Framework Directive. The topic, however, is hotly contested among scientists and policy makers. Existing legislation with regard to fine sediment was set by the EU Freshwater Fish Directive. Its guideline, i.e. mean annual suspended sediment concentration, is 25 mg l-1. Such a static target fails to capture the episodic nature of sediment transport. Furthermore, application of such global standards is inappropriate for a pollutant that is strongly controlled by spatial variation in key catchment drivers. Paleolimnology offers an approach for assessing background sediment pressures on watercourses, enabling determination of values for times pre-dating agricultural intensification. We propose that Modern Background Sediment Delivery to Rivers (MBSDR) across England and Wales can be determined using paleolimnology to quantify maximum feasible sediment reduction. No management programme should aim to reduce sediment loss to values below those resulting from background, natural physiographic and/or hydrological controls. Lacking generic tools to quantify process linkages between sediment pressures and biological impact, we propose that MBSDR could be taken to represent ecological demand for sediment inputs into watercourses required to support healthy aquatic habitats. In situations where generic tools exist for coupling sediment pressures and ecological impacts, assessment of MBSDR could be used to correct the gap between current or future projected sediment loss and biological condition. Existing paleolimnological data on sediment yields across England and Wales are presented to illustrate the approach and provide preliminary national estimates of MBSDR. We briefly consider the basis for reconstructing sediment yields using a paleolimnological approach and analyse temporal trends in published sediment yield, inferred for a range of landscape types. We also attempt to correlate sediment accumulation rates (SARs) with sediment yields to extend the MBSDR data base. Preliminary maps were generated to identify regions where further sediment yield data are needed to produce a more robust estimate of the spatial distribution of MBSDR across England and Wales.},

abstract = {Previous work on sediment budgets for U.S. agricultural regions has concluded that most sediment derived from accelerated erosion is still on the landscape, primarily in colluvial and alluvial deposits. Here we examine the role of small impoundments in the subcontinental sediment budget. A recent inventory based on a 30-m satellite imagery reveals approximately 2.6 million ponds, while extrapolation from a sample of 1:24,000 topographic quadrangles suggests the total may be as large as 8-9 million. These ponds capture an estimated 21{\%} of the total drainage area of the conterminous U.S., representing 25{\%} of total sheet and rill erosion. We estimate the total sedimentation in these small impoundments using three different methods; these estimates range from 0.43 to 1.78 × 109 m3 yr-1. Total sedimentation in ∼43,000 reservoirs from the National Inventory of Dams is estimated at 1.67 × 109 m3 yr-1. Total USLE erosion in 1992 was 2.4 × 109 m3 yr-1, and export to coastal areas is estimated at 0.6 × 109 m3 yr-1. Total sedimentation in impoundments is large in relation to upland erosion, in apparent contradiction to previous studies that have identified colluvial and alluvial deposition as the primary sinks. Several alternative hypotheses that could help explain this result are proposed. Regardless of which of these alternatives may prove to be the most significant in any given setting, it is clear that most sedimentation is now taking place in subaqueous rather than subaerial environments, and that small impoundments are a major sediment sink. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data for the Savannah River Site (SRS) in the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina, combined with geological, archaeological, and ecological data place new constraints on the evolution of Carolina Bays. Extant SRS bay morphology formed mainly during the Holocene and did not involve migration of bays across the landscape. Multiple periods of bay-rim accretion with intervening intervals of erosion may characterize the longer-term evolution of the bays. Bay evolution, however, did not involve significant modification of the Upland Unit underlying the region. During fluctuating, but generally open water conditions, breaking waves along bay shorelines eroded and transported sediment which was subsequently exposed for deflation during periods of low water. Deflation and transport of sand into standing vegetation along the margin of the bay depression created a rim in the form of a parabolic dune lacking obvious internal stratification. Simultaneously, infilling occurred by shoreline erosion and transport from adjacent elevated surfaces. This, coupled with growth of emergent vegetation, resulted in decreased hydroperiod, wave energy, shoreline modification, and rim accretion. Transport of some rim sediments back into the bays via alluvial and colluvial activity created wedges of infilling sediment during waning stages of evolution. The apparent contradiction of bay orientation with respect to prevailing winds might reflect seasonal changes in water level and wind direction: southwesterly winds during spring high water causes NW-SE elongation of the bays, whereas northwesterly winds during lower water in the fall and winter account for nearshore deflation and rim accretion along the east-southeastern bay margins.},

abstract = {Atmospherically-derived cosmogenic nuclides such as meteoric 10Be offer great potential in Quaternary science because they can be used as landform geochronometers and as sediment tracers. Use of meteoric 10Be inventories for determining landform age, soil residence time, or erosion rates requires knowing the long-term rate of deposition for this cosmogenic nuclide to the Earth's surface. Here, we present meteoric 10Be inventories measured at 6 dated sites near the Boulder Creek Critical Zone Observatory, Front Range, Colorado. Each site lies on a relatively stable landform (broad moraine or fluvial terrace) at slopes between {\textless}1 and 7° and supports well-developed soil horizons. Time-averaged rates of total meteoric 10Be deposition (precipitation, dryfall, and dust deposition) calculated from measured inventories at these sites range from 0.4 to 5.0×106atomscm-2yr-1; none of the inventories match expected primary meteoric 10Be deposition rates that global, latitude-based models or precipitation-specific models predict for this region. Meteoric 10Be inventories and calculated deposition rates at the three older ({\textgreater}90ka) sites fall below (0.3-0.7×) model predictions; inventories and rates at the three Pinedale-age sites (LGM; 21-15ka) are higher (1.5-4×) than model predictions. Previous analysis of soils in the Front Range over the same timeframe as these sites indicate that long-term dust accumulation rates are low and associated secondary meteoric 10Be deposition is unlikely to account for the deviation from model predictions. At the Pinedale-age sites in particular, long-term dustfall would have to be 1-2 orders of magnitude higher to add the meteoric 10Be required to account for measured inventories. Low inventories at older sites are consistent with loss of meteoric 10Be through physical erosion or selective removal of near-surface soil enriched in meteoric 10Be; time-averaged rates of total meteoric 10Be deposition for these sites are minima. We speculate that higher inventories at Pinedale-age sites reflect the addition of meteoric 10Be due to snowdrifts and/or interflow associated with landform location, increasing the effective precipitation-related primary meteoric 10Be deposition at the sampled sites. Given these constraints, and the spatial variation observed around the Front Range, we suggest that 1.5±0.2×106atomscm-2yr-1 is an appropriate long-term meteoric 10Be deposition rate to use across much of the Front Range region that receives 45-55cm of precipitation a year. This long-term total meteoric 10Be deposition rate is {\~{}}30-50{\%} higher than that predicted by global or annual precipitation-specific models, emphasizing that local calibration of deposition rates is essential for geomorphic studies around the globe.},

abstract = {Suspended-sediment concentrations, dis- charges, loads, and yields were determined for eight subbasins in the Housatonic River Basin in western Massachusetts, eastern New York, and northwestern Connecticut from April 1994 through March 1996. Suspended-sediment samples were collected at three continuous-record sediment stations and at four partial-record sediment stations. Suspended-sediment concentrations in samples collected during the period of study ranged from less than 0.5 to 3,400 milligrams per liter, and concurrent streamflows ranged from 0.03 to 126 cubic feet per second per square mile at the seven sta- tions. Median suspended-sediment concentrations in samples collected at each station ranged from 7 to 61 milligrams per liter. Median streamflows during suspended-sediment sampling ranged from 1.86 to 5.88 cubic feet per second per square mile. Instantaneous suspended-sediment yields ranged from less than 0.005 to 185 tons per day per square mile, and medians ranged from 0.03 to 1.12 tons per day per square mile at the seven stations. Total suspended-sediment loads (mass) from April 1994 through March 1996 at the continuous-record sediment stations were 11,603 tons at Housatonic River near Great Barrington, 7,929 tons at Green River, and 54,347 tons at Housatonic River near Ashley Falls. Suspended-sediment load during January 1996 at the Green River station accounted for about 54 percent of the total suspended-sediment load for the Green River during the 2-year study. Suspended-sediment load on January 19 and 20, 1996, at the Green River station accounted for about 50 percent of the January 1996 suspended- sediment load, or about 27 percent of the total suspended-sediment load during the 2-year study. This large suspended-sediment transport was the result of rainfall and snowmelt on January 19 and 20, 1996—the equivalent of a 5- to 6-inch rain storm in the Green River subbasin. Total suspended-sediment loads during the 2-year study at the partial-record sediment stations were 3,052 tons at Williams River, 1,758 tons at Ironworks Brook, and 17,927 tons at Konkapot River. Suspended-sediment yields from April 1994 through March 1996 at the continuous- record sediment stations were 21 (tons/yr)/mi2 at Housatonic River near Great Barrington, 78 (tons/yr)/mi2 at Green River, and 58 (tons/yr)/mi2 at Housatonic River near Ashley Falls. Suspended-sediment yields during the 2- year study at the partial-record sediment stations were 35 (tons/yr)/mi2 at Williams River, 78 (tons/yr)/mi2 at Ironworks Brook, and 147 (tons/yr)/mi2 at Konkapot River. Suspended- sediment yields were estimated for two subbasins in the Housatonic River Basin—Schenob Brook at Sheffield, a partial-record sediment station, and the area adjacent to the Housatonic River between Great Barrington and Ashley Falls. The estimate of suspended-sediment yield at Schenob Brook at Sheffield of 82 (tons/yr)/mi2 is comparable to the yield determined for the Green River and Ironworks Brook. The estimate of suspended- sediment yield for the area adjacent to the Housatonic River between Great Barrington and Ashley Falls was 395 (tons/yr)/mi2. This estimated suspended-sediment yield was 2.7 to 18.8 times greater than that estimated for any of the other subbasins. Several basin and land-use characteristics thought to affect suspended-sediment transport in the subbasins were compared to the suspended- sediment yields. The characteristics that seemed to affect suspended-sediment discharge were dams, which contributes to decreased yields; Hadley, Limerick, Linlithgo, Saco, and Winooski silt loam soils (high erodibility soils), which contributes to increased yields; stratified-drift deposits, which contributes to increased yields; and agricultural and open land, which contributes to increased yields. The effect of stratified-drift deposits on suspended-sediment discharge is thought to be greater when those deposits are of glaciolacustrine (generally clay, silt, and fine sand), rather than glaciofluvial (clay, silt, sand, gravel, and cobbles) origin. The silt loam soils, glaciolacustrine deposits, and agricultural and open land are interrelated, inasmuch as the silt loam soils generally are associated with glaciolacustrine deposits and agricultural activities.},

abstract = {Mountain regions throughout the world face intense development pressures associated with recreational and tourism uses. Despite these pressures, much of the research on bio-geophysical impacts of humans in mountain regions has focused on the effects of natural resource extraction. This paper describes findings from the first 3 years of a study examining high elevation watershed processes in a region undergoing alpine resort development. Our study is designed as a paired-watershed experiment. The Ranch Brook watershed (9{\textperiodcentered}6 km2) is a relatively pristine, forested watershed and serves as the undeveloped ‘control' basin. West Branch (11{\textperiodcentered}7 km2) encompasses an existing alpine ski resort, with approximately 17{\%} of the basin occupied by ski trails and impervious surfaces, and an additional 7{\%} slated for clearing and development. Here, we report results for water years 2001–2003 of streamflow and water quality dynamics for these watersheds. Precipitation increases significantly with elevation in the watersheds, and winter precipitation represents 36–46{\%} of annual precipitation. Artificial snowmaking from water within West Branch watershed currently augments annual precipitation by only 3–4{\%}. Water yield in the developed basin exceeded that in the control by 18–36{\%}. Suspended sediment yield was more than two and a half times greater and fluxes of all major solutes were higher in the developed basin. Our study is the first to document the effects of existing ski area development on hydrology and water quality in the northeastern US and will serve as an important baseline for evaluating the effects of planned resort expansion activities in this area.

abstract = {A decline of hemlock (Tsuga) populations at ca5.5ka (thousands of calibrated radiocarbon years before 1950AD) stands out as the most abrupt vegetation change of the Holocene in North America, but remains poorly understood after decades of study. Recent analyses of fossil pollen have revealed a concurrent, abrupt oak (Quercus) decline and increases in the abundance of beech (Fagus) and pine (Pinus) on Cape Cod in eastern Massachusetts, but the replacement of drought-tolerant oaks by moisture-sensitive beeches appears inconsistent with low lake levels in the region at the same time. The oak and beech changes are also limited to coastal areas, and the coastal-inland differences require an explanation. Here, we develop a new lake-level reconstruction from Deep Pond, Cape Cod by using a transect of sediment cores and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) profiles to constrain the past elevations of the sandy, littoral zone of the pond. The reconstruction shows that a series of multi-century episodes of low water coincide with the abrupt hemlock and oak declines, and interrupt subsequent phases of hemlock recovery. The lake-level variations equal precipitation deficits of {\~{}}100mm superimposed on a Holocene long moisture increase of {\textgreater}400mm. However, because moisture deficits do not easily explain the oak and beech changes, we also evaluate how the climate preferences of the regional vegetation changed over time by matching the fossil pollen assemblages from Deep Pond with their modern equivalents. Reconstructions of the precipitation requirements of the vegetation correlate well even in detail with the lake-level record (r=0.88 at Deep Pond), and indicate close tracking of effective moisture (precipitation minus evapotranspiration) by the vegetation despite the abrupt species declines, which could have decoupled climate and vegetation trends. Reconstructions of the temperature preferences of the vegetation indicate that coastal sites may have cooled by 0.5-2.5°C after ca5.5 ka, while inland sites warmed by 0.5-1C. The change in coastal temperature preferences agrees with sea surface cooling in the western Atlantic Ocean of 1°C. Consequently, the persistence of low hemlock abundance after 5.5 ka in the northeast U.S. may have resulted from oceanic changes that produced multi-century droughts and thus delayed the post-decline recovery of hemlock populations. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A mass-balance model based on the energy balance at the snow or ice surface is formulated, with particular attention paid to processes affecting absorption of radiation. The model is applied to a small glacier, Glacier AX010 in the Nepalese Himalaya, and tests of its mass-balance sensitivity to input and climatic parameters are carried out. Calculated and observed area-averaged mass balances of the glacier during summer 1978 June-September) show good agreement, namely -0.44 and -0.46 m w.e., respectively. Results show the mass balance is strongly sensitive to snow or ice albedo, to the effects of screening by surrounding mountain walls, to areal variations in multiple reflection between clouds and the glacier surface, and to thin snow covers which alter the surface albedo. In tests of the sensitivity of the mass balance to seasonal values of climatic parameters, the mass balance is found to be strongly sensitive to summer air temperature and precipitation but only weakly sensitive to relative humidity.},

abstract = {Dam-influenced streambank morphology has not been studied extensively in rivers in deglaciated landscapes with high densities of colonial-era milldams. Fluvial restoration in the eastern U.S. often focuses on understanding pre-Colonial floodplain processes. Recent work by Walter and Merritts (2008a) in the Piedmont of the U.S. mid-Atlantic region suggests milldams significantly impact sedimentation by creating surfaces composed of post-dam legacy sediment that are often abandoned by the river and function as fill terraces. I analyze channel morphology and sedimentation patterns upstream of two breached dams on the Sheepscot River in mid-coastal Maine using lidar digital elevation models, historical aerial photographs, radiocarbon dating, and hydraulic modeling. In the past several decades, observable channel morphologic changes occurred at the two study sites: Maxcy's Mills dam (built in 1809, it was 2-m high and breached in the late 1950s), and at Head Tide dam (built in the 1760s, it is 4-m high and was partially breached in 1952). The Sheepscot River has a native population of Atlantic salmon, which is a federally listed endangered species. Understanding the existence and transport of legacy sediment has become an important component of habitat restoration efforts in the region. The goal of this investigation is to determine the extent and morphologic function of legacy sediment in order to better understand how historical dam sites affect channel morphology and sediment transport in a post-glacial, low-gradient river system. Field and remote sensing analyses indicate that surfaces (up to 2.65 m high) composed of mud and sand function as floodplains 1 km upstream from Head Tide dam and surfaces 90 cm high continue 2.5 km upstream from Maxcy's Mills. Analysis of seven radiocarbon dates from pieces of tree bark sampled from the stratigraphy (58-187 cm below the surface) of the two study sites suggest up to 1.8 m of sediment upstream of the two study sites was deposited within the past 300 years and is therefore a legacy of the dams. Quantification of the total volume of stored legacy sediment is on the same scale as volumes observed in the mid-Atlantic Piedmont region, leading to the conclusion that post-glacial rivers in northern New England store milldam sediment in similar fashion to streams analyzed in the Walter and Merritts (2008a) study.},

abstract = {We gathered data on the age and depth of crystallization of mid-Paleozoic igneous and metamorphic rocks from 64 sites in and near Maine and also a time series of rock temperatures from the Casco Bay area of Maine. By fitting a trend surface to some of our geobarometric data, we estimated total erosion at the Casco Bay site in the last 284. m.y. and thus the geothermal gradient at that time. The temperatures could thus be converted to a time-series of erosion. Assuming Airy isostasy, we then obtained a time series of the mean height of the land surface above present sea level, represented by H.Of four erosion laws fit to the latter, a power law, E=$\nu$pHu where E is the erosion rate, and $\nu$p and u are fitting parameters, provides the best fit without excessive mathematical complexity. However, the exponent, u, is (unexpectedly){\textless}1. We attribute this to crustal thickening at a restraining bend in the Norumbega fault zone. In addition, data from opposite sides of the fault suggest that dip-slip motion has been significantly{\textgreater}6km and that it likely began in the late middle Paleozoic, thus extending earlier estimates of this component of displacement backward in time and upward in magnitude. A decrease in denudation rate in the early Mesozoic is interpreted as reflecting suturing of Gondwana and Laurentia to form Pangea; the denudation rate increased again following Mesozoic rifting. This latter increase occurs later to the northwest, suggesting retreat of a rift-flank escarpment at a rate of a few tenths of a millimeter per year.Using our full geobarometric data set, we calculated an average value of u of 1.2. We then generated topographic maps of the state at 380, 320, and 200. Ma. At 380. Ma, the mountains of western Maine were likely somewhat higher than today's Rocky Mountains. Drainage then was to the northeast, contributing sediment to the Maritimes Basin. The Alleghanian collision at {\~{}}. 320. Ma raised comparable mountains somewhat nearer the present coast in western Maine. Following Mesozoic rifting drainage was also to the southeast, into rift basins bordering the opening Atlantic Ocean. Since the Devonian, an average of {\textgreater}. 9. km of rock have been eroded from Maine. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Over the last 20 years there have been major improvements to our understanding of the Quaternary glaciation of New England. Numerous Accelerator Mass Spectrometer (AMS) 14C ages of terrestrial plant fossils have eliminated some of the errors associated with 14C ages of lake-bottom bulk sediment samples and marine fossils. The rebirth of Antevs' New England varve chronology and its 14C calibration have added precision to the Late Wisconsinan deglaciation chronology and a means of precisely testing correlations of deglacial events. Palaeomagnetic studies of both declination and polarity have allowed precise correlation between New England and adjacent areas. The exact chronology of pre-Late Wisconsinan glaciation is still poorly constrained because of difficulties in determining numerical ages. The terrestrial glacial record of New Jersey dictates that New England was glaciated at least twice in pre-Wisconsinan time, at least once when the geomagnetic field had a reversed polarity (pre-Illinoian, Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 22 or older, 850 ka) and again during the Illinoian (160-180 ka BP, MIS 6). Controversy exists concerning pre-Late Wisconsinan till in central and northern New England with its weathering supporting an Illinoian age and amino acid ages from reworked marine fossils in Boston Harbor supporting an Early Wisconsinan age. In the Connecticut Valley of southern New Hampshire and Vermont the advance of Late Wisconsinan ice buried advance outwash and lake beds were deposited in tributaries impounded by advancing ice. Late Wisconsinan ice reached its limit on islands along the southern coast at 24.0-20.0 14C ka BP (28.0-23.7 cal ka BP). The overall pattern of deglaciation was one of spurts of ice recession punctuated by readvances and end moraine building, and acceleration of ice recession over time. The early chronology of deglaciation (20.0-15.0 14C ka BP, 23.7-18.0 cal ka BP) has been inferred from correlations to Greenland ice core records and varve sequences have been used to crudely constrain the chronology. The later part of deglaciation (15.0-11.5 14C ka BP, 18.0-13.4 cal ka BP) has been determined precisely where basal ice-proximal varves are matched to the 14C-calibrated New England varve chronology in the Connecticut, Merrimack, Passumpsic, and Winooski Valleys. The resulting precise chronology of deglaciation in central and northern New England is about 1500 years younger than in previous models largely based on bulk sediment lakebottom 14C ages. A comparison of terrestrial 14C ages for ice margins in the Merrimack Valley with marine 14C ages for contemporaneous marine ice margins in southern Maine suggest that a 600-1300-yr marine reservoir correction should be applied to the marine chronology. Correlations between New England and New York have been formulated with the matching of independent palaeomagnetic declination records from both areas and the connection of icefront positions that appear to align geographically. There appears to be a contemporaneity of readvances in both regions that also match cold intervals on Greenland ice core records. These observations support a rapid response of the last ice sheet's ablation system to cold events. Following deglaciation a delayed isostatic tilting occurred across central to northern New England with water planes dipping 0.85-0.94 m/km towards the south-south-east. The nonglacial remnants of glacial lakes in the upper Connecticut Valley persisted until at least 10.5 14C ka BP 12.5 cal ka BP) and may have been seen by the first humans in the area. While isostatic uplift was well underway in southern and central New England recession of ice in Canada allowed the invasion of marine water into the Champlain Basin at about 11.0 14C ka BP (13.0 cal ka BP). This age estimate is consistent with previous studies that attempted to remove a reservoir error from marine 14C ages of Champlain Sea fossils. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Sediment focusing is a process whereby water turbulence moves sedimented material from shallower to deeper zones of a lake. Sediment focusing occurs in lakes in both the erosional (coarse-grained sediments) and the transportational zone with the latter characterized by discontinuous sedimentation and resuspension. The zone of accumulation is defined as the zone where sedimentation is final (i.e. no resuspension) and where there is no further sediment focusing. A geochemical tracer (Ph) was used to trace sediment focusing patterns in 12 lakes of different morphometries. The area occupied by the zone of accumulation is predicted from the mean basin slope (alpha'p) with 86{\%} of the variance explained. Only in large, exposed lakes in which turbulence from waves is more severe are the resulting sediment distributions more erratic. This study is the first to provide a general model of sediment focusing patterns among lakes.},

abstract = {Katahdin, the highest peak in Maine and part of the second highest mountain range in New England, provides an opportunity to assess the timing and style of continental ice sheet surface lowering during deglaciation. We collected 14 samples from boulders on the adjacent Basin Ponds moraine, from bedrock and boulders on the upper part of the mountain, and from boulders in the surrounding area to estimate the age at which they were exposed by deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Measurements of in situ produced 10Be, which are consistent with measurements of 26Al, indicate that the Katahdin edifice became exposed from under ice by 15.3±2.1ka (n=6), an age indistinguishable from the adjacent Basin Ponds moraine (16.1±1.2ka, n=5). A boulder in the lowlands several km south of the moraine dates to 14.5±0.8ka, and a boulder deposited at Pineo Ridge, about 170km SE of Katahdin, dates to 17.5±1.1ka. These data show that samples collected over an elevation range of 1.6km and a distance of {\textgreater}170km all have exposure ages that are indistinguishable within uncertainties. Together these data suggest that the Laurentide Ice Sheet surface dropped rapidly and the ice sheet margin retreated quickly across Maine between about 16 and 15ka, perhaps influenced by calving of the marine-based ice sheet in the St. Lawrence Lowlands to the north and the Penobscot basin to the south.},

abstract = {Humans, with their tools, brains, and expanding populations have been changing the Earth for millennia – moving soil, cutting trees, damming rivers, and altering the atmosphere. With the advent of fossil fuels, the rate at which people could change the Earth increased dramatically. Critical to understanding the magnitude of human impact and thus to determining what mitigation strategies might make the most sense and be most effective requires data – not only on the magnitude of human impact today but on background rates of change in the past. Cosmogenic nuclides, including Be-10, C-14, and Al-26 can be useful monitors of millennial scale rates of change that help place human impact in the proper geologic context. This talk provides several examples of how cosmogenic nuclides can help contextualize rates of change during the Anthropocene. Since the 1990s, measurements of cosmogenic nuclides in river sediment have been used to compare contemporary rates of sediment export with background rates of sediment generation - important data for understanding the global flux of sediment and sediment-associated nutrients to deltas and the world's oceans as well as estimating the filling rates of reservoirs. Where Anthropocene rates of sediment export have been measured, they typically exceed geologic rates of sediment generation by several times. Global compilations and many regional studies show average basin slope is a reasonable proxy for long-term erosion rates providing a simple, calibrated means to estimate rates needed to establish regulatory limits for sediment when it is considered a pollutant. Since the 1980s, a variety of different nuclides have been used to determine the history of now-vanished glaciers and ice sheets mostly by dating moraines. Recently, in light of rapid, human-induced climate change, cosmogenic nuclides have been used to understand better the sensitivity of ice sheets to past periods of warmth. Measurements of Be-10 and Al-26 in marine sediment cores, ice-bound cobbles, and rock recovered from under ice have been used to argue both for and against the long-term stability of the Greenland and Antarctic Ice Sheets. Such data, once we are better able to interpret it, could well allow us to see into the past and determine how Earth's ice sheets responded to past periods of exceptional warmth – our likely future.},

abstract = {Cosmogenic Al-26, Be-10. and C-14 dating of fluvial fill terraces in steep canyons of the Colorado Front Range provides a temporal framework for analysing episodic aggradation and incision. Results from Boulder Canyon show that terrace heights above the modern channel (grade) can be divided into: (1) Bull Lake (greater than or similar to100 ka; 20-15 m above grade); (2) Pinedale (32-10 ka; 15-4 m above grade); and (3) Holocene age ({\textless}4 to above grade). No pre-Bull Lake deposits are preserved along Boulder Canyon, and only three small remnants {\textgreater} 15 to above grade record Bull Lake deposition. Well-preserved terraces of Pinedale age suggest that the range of terrace height above grade reflects short-term fluctuations in the river profile during periods of rapidly changing stream load and power. Net river incision apparently occurred during transitions to interglacial periods. Soil development and stratigraphic position, along with limited cosmogenic and C-14 dating, suggest that similar to 130 ka terraces in Boulder Canyon correlate with the Louviers Alluvium, and that 32 to 10 ka fills in the canyon correlate with the Broadway Alluvium on the adjacent High Plains. Late Pleistocene incision rates (similar to0.15 m ka(-1)) along Boulder Canyon exceed pre-late Pleistocene incision rates, and are higher than middle to late Pleistocene incision rates (similar to0.04 m ka(-1)) on the High Plains.

In many applications, spatial variations in resistivity are useful as a proxy for variations in another bulk material property such as pore water salinity, clay content, porosity, or temperature. Applications of galvanic resistivity methods have been buoyed by the development of marine configurations that are now commercially available. In contrast, with two notable exceptions, most applications of EM induction methods have involved experimental adaptations of instruments originally designed for use on land. Methods for shallow water resistivity and EM induction surveys are at an exciting stage of development where several promising applications have been demonstrated but the suite of tools and components commercially available and widely tested remains relatively small.},

abstract = {The use of low-cost, low-profile, and highly portable sidescan sonar is on the ascendancy for imaging shallow riverine benthic sediments. A new automated, spatially explicit, and physically-based method for calculating lengthscales of bed texture elements in sidescan echograms (a 2D plot of acoustic intensity as a function of slant range and distance) is suggested. It uses spectral analysis based on the wavelet transform of short sequences of echograms. The recursive application of the transform over small overlapping windows of the echogram provides a robust measure of lengthscales of alternating patterns of strong and weak echoes. This textural lengthscale is not a direct measure of grain size. Rather, it is a statistical representation that integrates over many attributes of bed texture, of which grain size is the most important. The technique is a physically-based means to identify regions of texture within a sidescan echogram, and could provide a basis for objective, automated riverbed sediment classification. Results are evaluated using data from two contrasting riverbed environments: those of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, Arizona, and the West Branch of the Penobscot River, Maine.},

abstract = {Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) transects and sediment cores have been used to examine the basement morphology, stratig- raphy, and environmental history of maritime ponds along the pen- insular coast of Maine. Silver Lake, Lily Pond, and North Pond are shallow (? 3 m) water bodies bordered by steep bedrock ridges in the north, east, and west, and sandy barriers to the south. The bedrock basins of the ponds are formed in metasedimentary rocks surrounded by resistant pegmatitic intrusions. A dense network of GPR traverses obtained over the ice-covered Silver Lake reveals a series of prominent wavy-parallel and basin-fill reflector geometries terminating against the bedrock or grading into the barrier sediments and interpreted as organic lake-bottom facies. The transparent units represent sand-rich horizons, mostly eolian in origin. Convex-up structures found both on the surface and within the basin-fill sequence are interpreted as pre- served parts of coastal dunes. The present study indicates that fresh- water conditions prevailed since at least 4.6 ka, with an initial sedi- mentation rate of 1.7 mm/yr. The position of this unit below the con- temporary sea level suggests presence of a welded barrier by that time. Radar profiles taken along the shores of Lily Pond, a small water body behind the Sand Dune Barrier, indicate a significantly larger areal extent of the pond in the past. A succession of organic deposits over- lying a Pleistocene glaciomarine unit indicates progressive inundation of the paleo-lagoon by rising sea level. Saltwater peat seaward of Lily Pond was buried by washover sands about 1.2 ka, and a narrow pond existed here prior to dredging and artificial infilling of its eastern part in the 1950s–60s. The organic and eolian units are absent in the North Pond, where sedimentary fill consists of glaciomarine clay overlain by marine sands. A proposed three-stage model of pond evolution along an embayed coastline consists of: (1) organic accumulation in an up- land depression during lower sea level; (2) predominantly washover or tidal deposition in a lagoon (Stage 2a) or blocked coastal pond (Stage 2b) during initial transgression, and (3) mainly eolian and organic de- position behind a prograded or aggraded barrier. Future accelerated rise in relative sea level and inadequate sediment supply will cause many back-barrier ponds to reenter Stage 2 of the proposed model.},

abstract = {Recession of the Laurentide Ice Sheet from northern New Hampshire was interrupted by the Littleton-Bethlehem (L-B) readvance and deposition of the extensive White Mountain Moraine System (WMMS). Our mapping of this moraine belt and related glacial lake sequence has refined the deglaciation history of the region. The age of the western part of the WMMS is constrained to {\~{}}14.0–13.8 cal ka BP by glacial Lake Hitchcock varves that occur beneath and above L-B readvance till and were matched to a revised calibration of the North American Varve Chronology presented here. Using this age for when boulders were deposited on the moraines has enabled calibration of regional cosmogenic-nuclide production rates to improve the precision of exposure dating in New England. The L-B readvance coincided with the Older Dryas (OD) cooling documented by workers in Europe and the equivalent GI-1d cooling event in the Greenland Ice Core Chronology 2005 (GICC05) time scale. The readvance and associated moraines provide the first well-documented and dated evidence of the OD event in the northeastern United States. Our lake sediment cores show that the Younger Dryas cooling was likewise prominent in the White Mountains, thus extending the record of this event westward from Maine and Maritime Canada.},

abstract = {The Laurentide Ice Sheet was a major driver of global sea-level change during the last deglaciation and may have impacted both atmospheric and oceanic circulation. An understanding of past changes in the ice sheet is important for constraining its interaction with other components of the climate system. Here, we present the geologic context and chronology for ice-sheet fluctuations in eastern Maine, adjacent to the North Atlantic Ocean, thought to be a key player in the termination of the last ice age. Retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet through coastal Maine first produced a series of lobate grounding-line moraines, followed by deposition of the prominent Pineo Ridge System, which crosscut the earlier moraine set and which is characterized by extensive ice-contact deltas, closely spaced parallel moraines, and association with eskers. Our new 10Be surface exposure ages indicate that the Pineo Ridge System, which extends for more than 100 km in eastern Maine and Atlantic Canada, dates to ∼15.3 ka, ∼800 years older than recent estimates. Our data are in accord with inboard minimum-limiting radiocarbon ages of terrestrial materials, which indicate deglaciation as early as 15.3 ka, as well as of marine shells that are as old as 15.0 ka. Both the deglaciation that produced the lobate moraines and the short-lived readvance that led to the Pineo Ridge System occurred during Heinrich Stadial 1. Given that faunal and isotopic evidence indicates that the ocean remained cold during deglaciation of coastal Maine, we infer that ice recession was due to rising summer air temperatures that gave way briefly to cooling to allow minor readvance. Glacial deposits north of the Pineo Ridge System display evidence of ice stagnation and downwasting, suggesting rapid ice retreat following deposition of the delta-moraine complex, coincident with the onset of the B{\o}lling.},

abstract = {We use sediment accumulation in ponds and reservoirs to examine upland sediment sources and sinks in the Piedmont physiographic region of Maryland, USA. In zero-order and first-order watersheds, sediment yield is greatest from suburban land cover, followed by agriculture and forest. The idea that sediment yield is small from mature suburban development appears to not be correct. First-order channel enlargement is an important sediment source, causing sediment yield to increase from zero-order to first-order watersheds. Nonchannel sources provide one-third to two-thirds of the upland sediment load.Long-term sediment accumulation in a reservoir at fifth-order indicates that cumulative sediment load from upland areas is reduced by one-quarter by net valley bottom sedimentation. If upland supply exceeds the load delivered from a watershed, sediment must accumulate along valley bottoms. In our study watershed, net sedimentation rate (sedimentation less erosion) averaged over valley bottom area is 2.6. mm/y, a value that is similar to independent direct measurements of sedimentation and erosion in a nearby watershed. Evaluation of the relative contributions to sediment mass balance of upland supply, valley bottom sedimentation and erosion, and watershed delivery indicates that, if valley-bottom rates of sedimentation exceed erosion as indicated by recent studies, then the proportion of watershed sediment delivery derived from stream banks is necessarily small.Although sediment yield estimated from stream gage records is similar in magnitude to that from ponds for watersheds smaller than 20km2, sediment yield from reservoir sedimentation is a factor of five larger than that estimated from gage records for watersheds larger than 140km2. This observation confirms that the different methods provide very different estimates of sediment yield. This possibility is reinforced by a sediment yield of 14Mg/km2/y from a gage immediately above a reservoir with a yield of 142Mg/km2/y based on reservoir accumulation.},

abstract = {The glacial geology of Maine records the northward recession of the Late Wisconsinan Laurentide Ice Sheet, followed by development of a residual ice cap in the Maine-Qu??bec border region due to marine transgression of the St. Lawrence Lowland in Canada. The pattern of deglaciation across southern Maine has been reconstructed from numerous end moraines, deltas and submarine fans deposited during marine transgression of the coastal lowland. Inland from the marine limit, a less-detailed sequence of deglaciation is recorded by striation patterns, meltwater channels, scattered moraines and waterlain deposits that constrain the trend of the ice margin. There is no evidence that the northern Maine ice cap extended as far south-west as the Boundary Mountains and New Hampshire border. Newly-obtained radiocarbon ages from marine and terrestrial ice-proximal environments have improved the chronology of glacial recession in Maine. Many of these ages were obtained by coring Late-glacial sediments beneath ponds and lakes. Data from this study show that the state was deglaciated between about 14.5 and 10.0 ka BP (14C years). The coastal moraine belt in southern Maine was deposited by oscillatory ice-margin retreat during the cold pre-B??lling time. Rapid ice recession to northern Maine then occurred between 13 and 11 ka BP, during the warmer B??lling/Aller??d chronozones. Radiocarbon-dated pond sediments in western and northern Maine show lithological evidence of Younger Dryas climatic cooling and persistence of the northern ice cap into Younger Dryas time. A large discrepancy still exists between radiocarbon ages of deglaciation in coastal south-western Maine and the timing of ice retreat indicated by New England varve records in areas to the west. Part of this problem may stem from the uncertainty of reservoir corrections applied to the radiocarbon ages of marine organics. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Both human activity and climate change can influence erosion rates and initiate rapid landscape change. Understanding the relative impact of these factors is critical to managing the risks of extreme erosion related to flooding and landslide occurrence. Here we present a 2100 year record of sediment mass accumulation and inferred erosion based on lacustrine sediment cores from Amherst Lake, Vermont, USA. Using deposition from August 2011 Tropical Storm Irene as a modern analogue, we identified distinct event deposits indicative of destructive erosion events. These deposits record a prolonged (multidecadal) interval of enhanced erosion following the initial storm-induced landscape disturbance. The direct impact of human land cover alteration is minimal in comparison to the more recent twentieth century increase in the occurrence of catastrophic erosion linked to overall wetter conditions that favor high erosion rates and more easily trigger landslides during periods of extreme precipitation.

@article{Uchupi2001,
abstract = {We propose that late Wisconsin deposition and erosion (Hudson Shelf and Block Island valleys) on the shelf and slope from New Jersey to southern New England were a consequence of the catastrophic drainage of glacial lakes behind terminal moraine systems and the huge volume of water stored beneath the Laurentian ice sheet and subsequent erosion of the lake sediments by flash floods. The morphology imparted by glaciation regulated the discharge associated with the ablation of the glaciers. Associated with the deposits west of Hudson Shelf Valley are the remains of mammoth and mastodon which were transported from their living habitats along the lake shores to their present burial sites on the shelf. The floods also triggered gravity flows on the upper continental slope which made possible the transportation of coarse debris over hundreds of km into the deep-sea. That these catastrophic flood morphologies can still be recognized on the middle to outer shelf suggest that much of its surface was little modified during the late Pleistocene/Holocene transgression. Thus the late Pleistocene/Holocene transgression may have been characterized by short periods when sea level rose rapidly allowing for the preservation of relict features. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

@article{Jol1991,
abstract = {Ground penetrating radar (GPR) was used in several selected deltaic sedimentary environments to better understand subsurface stratigraphy and reconstruct former depositional environments. The profiles provide high-resolution, continuous subsurface data on facies thickness and depths, orientation of major sedimentary structures, postdepositional failure planes, and depth of peat deposits. Field experiments were carried out on six river deltas. Records from four of the deltas exhibit sedimentary facies; a record from one delta shows a possible slump; and records from another delta reveal the thickness and stratigraphic relationships of peat deposits. The delta types are (i) sandy, wave influenced; (ii) sandy, immature wave influenced (steeper middle and lower shoreface); (iii) sandy braided; and (iv) gravelly, fan-foreset. In areas of limited subsurface control (stratigraphic logs from drill core, cutbank exposure, or geophysical logs), radar profiles can provide ``big picture'' perspectives of the subsurface, a view only available in laterally extensive exposures. High-resolution profiles of subsurface stratigraphy and sedimentary facies from GPR provide an opportunity for geomorphologists and sedimentologists to further advance field research. Although GPR has limited success in silt and clay, results from sand and gravel deposits often reveal detailed facies assemblages.},
