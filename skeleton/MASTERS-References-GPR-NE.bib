abstract = {We used 135-MHz ground-penetrating-radar GPR reflection profiles to determine if high-explosive HE depth bombs were possibly detonated within a small New England lake formerly used as a bombing range, as well as the depths and distribution of inert and possibly unexploded ordnance UXO within the subbottom sediments. Maximum water depth was 8.6 m. The primary munitions were unarmed practice bombs, but terrestrial fragments from HE depth bombs led us to seek stratigraphic obliteration and distortion as evidence of their use. The low water conductivity and quartz-rich sediments provided more than 8 m of subbottom penetration beneath slope and shelf sediments. The high permittivities of the water and subbottom sediments provided good antenna directivity, excellent 2D migrations, multicentimeter vertical resolution, and a unique pulse waveform signature for metal objects. Our line profiles revealed hundreds of subbottom diffractions, which implied an areal distribution of thousands of suspicious objects. Most lay beneath the central basin, but many resided beneath the slopes and shelves as well. Supplementary profiles of a nearby pristine lake and of controlled munitions, a side-scan sonar bottom survey, and time-domain reflectometry dielectric measurements of sediment samples corroborated our findings of natural stratigraphy, a unique metallic diffraction phase signature, the existence of many nonmetallic objects including logs, and subbottom relative permittivities ranging from 28 to 76. The intact natural lacustrine strata, including deltaic foresets and bottom sets, faults, and conformable and unconformable horizons, suggest that live bombs likely did not detonate in the lake. The only stratigraphic disturbances we found were apparent perforations beneath about 1 m of water, within which diffractions of metallic origin originated. The dielectric results and the prominent slope strata over the deepest horizons led us to conclude that the exceptional subbottom penetration existed under predominantly sandy sediments.},

abstract = {Turbidites within Holocene lacustrine sediment cores occur worldwide and are valued deposits that record a history of earthquakes or storms. Without sedimentary architecture however, interpretation of the cause, provenance, and behaviour of their parent turbidity currents are speculative. Here, these interpretations are made from 2D ground-penetrating radar (GPR) images of shore-to-shore architecture beneath three, previously-cored lakes within the low seismicity New England (U.S.A) region. Shallow depths, low water and sediment conductivities, and signal sensitivity to density contrasts uniquely provided up to 30 m of sediment signal penetration. Core comparisons and signal analysis reveal most horizons represent multi-decimetre-thick clusters of Holocene turbidites, which are denser than their organic-rich silt matrix. Some horizons also represent erosional unconformities and sediment bypass interfaces. The key, common, architectural consequences of turbidity current activity include limited foreset progradation, conformably pinched or unconformable layers of organic-rich sediment onlapped against slopes beneath 5â€“6 m of water, and mounded stratified sediments beneath rises. These features indicate that turbidity currents repeatedly bypassed the same slope without deposition and regardless of dip, and then simultaneously armoured and bypassed inter-turbidite sediment along rises and basins to provide basinward, generally age-conformable accumulation. The mounding precludes significant basinward focusing. Variable horizon amplitude suggests meter-scale changes in armouring density. Unconformities localized near breaks in dip beneath slopes suggest erosive hydraulic jumps. One lake shows evidence of historically maintained channels associated with specific deltas. Shelf strata indicating inland current generation, similar key architecture in other, uncored lakes, countable, lake-wide horizons, and absent slumps, slides, and faults are consistent with storm-driven turbidity currents, and with previous, core-based conclusions that severe, Holocene storms were episodic throughout this region. The results generalize marine bypass and armouring to lacustrine settings, and so likely occur worldwide in lakes subject only to storms, including lakes where GPR may locate core sites.},
