\begin{abstract}

This is the abstract. Sentence two. Formatting is easy when you use \LaTeX\ and it's easy to control. It excels in the math environement but tables can sometimes require more effort. Fortunately, it's open source (i.e. free), platform independent, and there's a big user community. There's a list of resources at the end.
