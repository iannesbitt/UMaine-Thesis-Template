## University of Maine Thesis Template

*Last Updated by Steven Bernsen 11/07/2017*

#### General
This template is available for anyone to use. The original Tex document from the UMaine website was modified to the current format because it was being neglected.

#### Updates
Providing the most up-to-date template requires the help of those who are using this template. This is an ongoing process so updates to the formatting can be made after the graduate office provides revisions on a students submitted thesis. Please let me know (in person or via email: *steven.bernsen@maine.edu*) of any corrections.
